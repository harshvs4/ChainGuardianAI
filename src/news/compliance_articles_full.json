    "full_text": "Joe Camberato is the CEO and Founder of National Business Capital, a leading fintech marketplace offering streamlined small business loans.   In the U.S., fintech companies are regulated by multiple state and federal agencies. Navigating the regulatory landscape is a challenge. In fact, Alloy\u2019s 2023 State of Compliance report found that 93% of fintech companies struggle to meet compliance standards, and 60% of surveyed companies paid over $250,000 in compliance fines in the past year. I believe this may be in part because fintech companies are built on the promise of a seamless customer experience. The process is meant to be easy and intuitive, so the customer journey often takes precedence over compliance. However, if you want to avoid fines, sanctions and legal challenges, you need to find a way to balance both. As we approach the new year, here are the top five regulatory issues facing fintech companies and strategies for staying compliant. Fintech companies deal with a lot of sensitive information including customer names, birthdates, Social Security numbers and bank account information. So, they have to deal with various state, federal and international data privacy laws. For example, they must comply with the California Privacy Rights Act, which regulates how businesses collect, store and share customer information. After California passed this legislation, other states passed their own state data privacy laws. Companies also have to comply with the General Data Privacy Regulation, an EU law. Canada also has its own data privacy law called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, which applies to companies in every sector. The first step to staying compliant with these regulations is to know what they are. Identify any relevant data privacy laws your business is subject to and monitor any emerging laws. From there, you can develop clear policies regarding how your business collects and transfers customer data. KYC is a process financial companies use to verify their customers\u2019 identities and prevent money laundering. KYC is critical for banks, insurance companies and fintech companies. Here are the three main requirements you need to know about: \u2022 Customer Identification Program: Financial companies need four types of identification for every client\u2014their name, birthdate, address and identification number. The identification number can either be a Social Security number or employer identification number. \u2022 Customer Due Diligence: During this process, companies must gather that customer\u2019s information, verify their identity and evaluate their level of risk. \u2022 Enhanced Due Diligence: If you have customers who are at a higher risk for terrorism or money laundering, enhanced due diligence is required. For example, foreign customers living in countries with a high risk of money laundering require enhanced due diligence. To remain compliant with KYC, it\u2019s important to make the customer onboarding process straightforward and easy to follow. Let your customers know what information you need from them and why. It\u2019s also important that you have a process for verifying the data you receive. Without the right authentication measures in place, fintech companies can easily be tricked by stolen documents. Since criminals can easily adapt and find ways to exploit KYC checks, you need to monitor and adjust these processes over time. The U.S. has continued to strengthen its AML regulations and most recently made changes in 2021 by passing the Anti-Money Laundering Act. This law enacted new whistleblower protections for individuals employed by financial services companies. AML regulations protect the integrity of the financial system, prevent terrorist financing and maintain public trust. The following is required for fintech companies to stay compliant: \u2022 Have a compliance officer in place. \u2022 Provide ongoing training on updates to AML legislation. \u2022 Monitor any transactions over $10,000. \u2022 Watch out for suspicious transactions. \u2022 Screen clients to ensure they aren\u2019t on the sanctions list. \u2022 Submit a Suspicious Activity Report within 30 days of spotting any suspicious activity. You can improve your company\u2019s AML compliance by using software to automate this process and eliminate any manual checking. Artificial intelligence can also help your company improve its ability to identify and measure risk. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in 2011 and is tasked with overseeing consumer protection laws. The CFPB collects and investigates consumer complaints and regularly goes after financial companies that engage in unfair practices. For example, one fintech company was fined $6 million after the CFPB said it violated consumer lending laws. To avoid these kinds of fines, provide disclosures to customers in a timely manner and make any lending terms transparent. You also need fair and objective criteria for evaluating loan applicants. All credit scoring models must be transparent and can\u2019t discriminate based on race or gender. Not only is the fintech industry highly regulated, but the rules and regulations are constantly changing. As new threats emerge, governments introduce new compliance standards to address these risks. Fintech companies need to be able to adapt to regulatory changes to avoid fines and penalties. The best way to do this is by collaborating with regulatory officers to stay on top of these changes as they occur. Using compliance management software can also help you stay on top of emerging financial trends. The information provided here is not legal, investment, tax or financial advice.

    "full_text": "Anushree Rajendra Jain is a Senior Manager at Titan.   The rapid evolution of financial technology has transformed the financial industry, creating unparalleled opportunities while imposing significant regulatory challenges. As digital transactions and global interconnectivity grow, fintech companies face increasing scrutiny to meet compliance standards, prevent financial crimes and safeguard consumer trust. Noncompliance is costly due to fines, sanctions and reputational damage. Against this backdrop, mastering compliance isn\u2019t just a legal obligation. Rather, it is a cornerstone of sustainable business strategy, fostering investor confidence and long-term resilience. Regulatory bodies are sharpening their focus on preventing money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and ensuring consumer protection. The high-stakes environment has created a demand for professionals with exceptional skills in risk management, audit, governance and reporting to lead effective issue management efforts. With experience working in compliance roles at organizations including Robinhood and Titan, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how strategic approaches to regulatory challenges can foster resilience in a rapidly changing landscape. For fintech companies, compliance is not a checkbox exercise; it\u2019s an opportunity to build trust and enhance operational efficiency. The fintech industry\u2019s global economic impact is staggering. By 2030, its market size is projected to reach $698 billion. For companies navigating this space, strategic compliance can foster investor confidence and enable sustainable expansion. A strong compliance program begins with the early detection and proactive management of risks. Creating an environment where employees feel empowered to report concerns is essential for success. In my experience, fostering open communication across teams through regular compliance check-ins has been highly effective in encouraging employees to flag potential issues. Additionally, implementing clear protocols for identifying, documenting and escalating risks\u2014such as detailed risk assessment frameworks and streamlined reporting channels\u2014ensures no critical details are overlooked. Conducting training sessions focused on compliance awareness has further helped employees recognize and address risks promptly. Efforts like these can help your organization address challenges effectively before they escalate into larger problems. Strong issue management hinges on partnerships that bridge departments and geographies. Collaborating with cross-functional teams can enhance the efficacy of your compliance practices. Regular connect points among teams promote transparency and alignment, enabling a seamless flow of information and coordinated responses. Consistent reporting is essential for effective oversight. Advanced tools such as ServiceNow dashboards can help your team track and report compliance issues. Structured governance frameworks ensure that escalations and decisions are well-documented and reviewed by leadership, reinforcing accountability and adherence to regulatory standards. Cybersecurity is a critical element that intersects with compliance in fintech. With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, it is imperative for compliance teams to adopt a holistic approach that incorporates cybersecurity risk management into their practices. According to IBM\u2019s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach report, the financial sector incurs the second-highest breach costs globally, averaging $6.08 million per incident. To safeguard sensitive customer data and financial information, implementing measures such as multifactor authentication, end-to-end encryption and real-time breach monitoring is essential. For instance, intrusion detection systems help identify potential threats proactively, while regular penetration testing allows your organization to address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Additionally, conducting employee training on recognizing phishing attempts and securing access to critical systems has proven effective in mitigating risks. By aligning these cybersecurity protocols with compliance requirements, your organization can reduce the risk of data breaches while enhancing consumer trust and reinforcing its overall compliance posture. The fast-paced nature of fintech demands that compliance programs evolve alongside regulatory changes and business growth. Organizations must regularly review and refine their policies, procedures and control measures so they remain effective and aligned with industry standards. Training programs play a pivotal role in driving continuous improvement. From my experience, targeted training sessions focused on areas such as anti-money laundering protocols, data protection regulations and fraud detection methodologies have significantly improved issue escalation rates. These sessions included interactive case studies, scenario-based exercises and compliance quizzes, which enabled team members to apply regulatory concepts in practical contexts. By designing and delivering such comprehensive training, compliance leaders can empower teams with the knowledge and tools needed to manage risks effectively, fostering a heightened awareness of responsibilities and promoting a culture of proactive compliance. To maintain a competitive advantage, fintech companies must integrate forward-thinking strategies that prepare them for emerging regulatory trends. Professionals who manage complex, multifaceted projects while collaborating with global stakeholders and adapting to evolving regulations will be invaluable in driving compliance success. Proactive issue identification, cross-functional collaboration, structured reporting and a commitment to continuous improvement will help your organization navigate future challenges. Effective leadership in issue management is not just about maintaining compliance; it\u2019s about empowering safe and responsible growth. By leveraging strong governance frameworks, robust cybersecurity measures and forward-looking compliance strategies, your company can foster trust and drive sustainable innovation that benefits the business and customers alike.

    "full_text": "Mohamed Madkour is the Director of Business Development and Relationships at Mastercard EEMEA.   Payment cards that are issued in minutes, not months\u2014that's card as a service (CaaS). This model offers a smart, simple way to meet customer payment needs while bypassing resource-heavy legacy infrastructure. CaaS is transforming industries with offerings like business fleet cards and eco-friendly payments to adaptable solutions for the gig economy. The key, however, is not just delivering on the needs but exceeding them. Today\u2019s customers expect fast, personalized and seamless experiences. Custom card services with real-time insights and advanced analytic tools allow companies to fine-tune products, track spending habits and enhance customer engagement and loyalty. From commercial cards supporting supplier payments to consumer products like buy now and pay later, the CaaS use cases are limitless. It\u2019s enablement and innovation at scale! Having spent over a decade in the payments industry, I've seen firsthand how the traditional card issuance process creates bottlenecks for fintechs and financial institutions in the MENA region and beyond. This challenge became particularly apparent while working with emerging fintechs struggling to launch their card programs quickly and cost-effectively. To resolve this global challenge, I'm dedicated to standardizing the current card issuance system through CaaS from both commercial and academic points of view. CaaS reduces time to market and aligns with several banking trends, like fintech (which now stands at $300 billion globally) and customer demand for integrated experiences, regulatory openness, new revenue models, technology adoption and shifting trust levels in financial services, as identified by McKinsey. When choosing the right CaaS operating model, I believe organizations should focus on aligning their approach with their strengths and long-term goals. \u2022 BIN Sponsorship Only: This is the simplest option\u2014when the organization provides BIN sponsorship, relying entirely on external partners for processing and management. \u2022 BIN Sponsorship And Processing: This model allows organizations to focus on core competencies, like BIN sponsorship and processing, and outsource customer-facing aspects or program management to partners\u2014a balance between control and resource investment. \u2022 End-To-End CaaS Player: This end-to-end model gives organizations complete control over the process, from BIN sponsorship and processing to program management. But it requires the most resources and expertise for successful execution. To build a successful CaaS foundation, start by asking questions about your objectives and goals. This requires creating several core capabilities, such as the following: \u2022 Business Development: Build a dedicated team to manage partnerships and capture new business opportunities through targeted marketing strategies, pre-sales support and RFI/RFP collaterals for potential partners. \u2022 Pipeline Management: Create a well-organized pipeline process for efficient deal management, prioritization and reports, ensuring a smooth transition from prospecting to deal closure. \u2022 Due Diligence: Due diligence in CaaS infrastructure involves developing standardized assessment questionnaires and setting go/no-go decision criteria. \u2022 Deal Making: Create a structured framework and negotiate deals that increase profit margins and value. Define pricing models and metrics, like customer lifetime value (CLV) and ROI, to evaluate deal structures. \u2022 BIN Sponsorship Execution: Develop capabilities for BIN sponsorships, program approvals and risk controls to prevent fraud and ensure regulatory compliance such as KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (anti-money laundering) and digital identity. \u2022 Technical Integration: Develop the ability to lead and coordinate technical integrations with partners and service providers. \u2022 Relationship Management: Implement processes for ongoing support, performance monitoring and customer service to maintain strong relationship management with partners and clients. \u2022 API Integration: Simple and effective API integration between CaaS platforms and internal systems helps customize card products, manage transactions and monitor compliance without heavy infrastructure. \u2022 Cloud-Based Platforms: Take advantage of cloud computing to scale effortlessly, whether expanding to new markets or increasing card volumes\u2014all without large capital. \u2022 Fraud Detection Systems: Advanced machine learning and AI models detect fraud in real time, ensuring safety and reducing operational risks. \u2022 Data Analytical Tools: Embedded analytical tools in CaaS platforms track customer behaviors, card usage and transaction trends, helping enhance customer experience and identify new revenue opportunities. Regulatory compliance is critical to any financial service\u2019s success, with KPMG\u2019s 2024 banking trends highlighting stricter requirements. Non-compliance triggers penalties, legal consequences and brand damage. CaaS providers must ensure regional and global regulatory compliance through robust frameworks, risk assessments and fraud monitoring systems that involve partner and program capabilities for each sponsored entity. Choosing the right partners based on technical capabilities, regulatory expertise and market readiness is essential for CaaS's success with flexible commercial pricing models like the following: \u2022 Cost-Plus: Ideal for low-risk, predictable partnerships prioritizing operational expenses. \u2022 Value-Sharing: Best for growth and shared success-based partnerships with incentives tied to value creation. \u2022 Hybrid: A balanced approach that covers costs while providing shared rewards. Additionally, clearly defining service-level agreements (SLAs) ensures quality service with a framework for continuous support and performance monitoring. Reliable partnerships allow organizations to focus on core competencies while leaving technical and operational details to experts. CaaS operational excellence requires efficient card issuance, transaction processing and dispute resolution to ensure customer satisfaction. Building trust through quick, reliable service delivery is vital. Regular team training with industry best practices, plus automation, reduces errors and improves operational efficiency for market growth. Scaling CaaS operations requires strategic investments in infrastructure, partnerships and process automation to handle growing demand efficiently. Monitor KPIs like transaction volume, uptime and customer satisfaction to track progress and identify areas for improvement. Use data insights, customer feedback and continuous innovation to scale and adapt to shifting regulations, customer demands and competition. We're experiencing a continuous shift in commerce, where every mobile device is a gateway to a digital transaction. With payment flow digitization advancing, success demands clear strategies and strong partnerships across the entire value chain. With CaaS, fintechs can streamline their current capacities with future goals. Through regulatory-compliant platforms that are simple, interoperable and quick, CaaS enables businesses to focus on growth rather than tech complexities. Using data insights, CaaS connects billions of buyers and sellers through agile ecosystems. To achieve true financial inclusion, we have to bring together emerging business models and traditional markets\u2014CaaS makes the way for you.

    "full_text": "Serge Beck, the founder and CEO of Omniwire, is driven by his belief that people deserve robust and secure financial services.   Embedded finance is estimated to have reached a market value of $84.12 billion in 2023, projected to grow at a CAGR of 32.81% from 2024 to 2033. With 56% of businesses already offering at least one form of embedded finance, white-label neobanking is here to stay. Businesses need solutions that are both quick and customizable, which is exactly where white-label neobanking outshines traditional approaches. White-label neobanking empowers companies to launch financial products under their own brand without building any infrastructure or navigating complex regulations. Let's explore how this approach works along with its benefits and challenges. First, let's look at the rise of embedded finance, which has been driven by the growth of neobanks and banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platforms. Neobanks emerged in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which eroded trust in traditional banks and sparked demand for more transparent, customer-centric financial solutions. With the rapid adoption of smartphones, neobanks like Revolut, Current and SoFi gained traction, offering features such as real-time spending notifications and low-cost international transfers. However, their expansion brought challenges, including regulatory hurdles and profitability pressures, especially as traditional banks improved their digital offerings. BaaS has since transformed the financial landscape, enabling licensed banks to integrate digital banking services into nonbank businesses. White-label neobanking, a key component of BaaS, allows companies to deliver branded banking products to customers seamlessly. This model has helped neobanks deploy new services faster, reduce time-to-market and scale efficiently. By 2023, the global neobank market exceeded $4.96 trillion, with forecasts suggesting it will reach $10.44 trillion by 2028. Similarly, the white-label neobanking sector is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.6% from 2021 to 2028. These innovations are driving the shift toward \"contextual banking,\" embedding financial services precisely where customers need them. White-label neobanking allows businesses to offer some banking services under their own brand by leveraging third-party financial institutions' infrastructure. This model utilizes API-driven solutions and infrastructure-as-a-service platforms to seamlessly integrate neobanking functionalities into nonfinancial products and services. The typical white-label neobanking deployment involves a few key steps: 1. A nonfinancial business partners with a white-label neobanking provider that offers access to their licensed neobanking infrastructure and APIs. 2. The business builds its own branded financial products and services on top of the white-label platform, customizing the user experience to match its branding needs. 3. The end users interact with the business's branded financial services, unaware that the underlying technology and licensing are provided by the white-label neobanking partner. I've come to find that businesses choose white-label neobanking solutions for several key reasons: \u2022 Deploying financial services in-house can be resource-intensive, whereas white-label models offer a more cost-effective path to market. \u2022 White-label platforms are designed to scale infrastructure and compliance, allowing businesses to grow their financial offerings with ease. \u2022 Rather than building complex financial technology from scratch, businesses can leverage pre-built white-label solutions to launch new products much faster. \u2022 White-label neobanking enables businesses to concentrate on their primary products and services while leaving the financial technology and compliance to specialized providers. White-label neobanking solutions offer notable advantages for businesses looking to integrate financial services into their offerings: Chime, the largest digital banking platform in the U.S., has built its entire banking service on top of Bancorp's white-label infrastructure. This allows Chime to offer a fully branded mobile banking app and debit card to its customers while Bancorp handles the complex regulatory and technology requirements behind the scenes. By leveraging the infrastructure and back-end services provided by white-label partners, businesses can build customized financial products that seamlessly blend with their existing branding and customer experience. White-label neobanking enables a cohesive user journey where customers can access some banking features directly within the familiar app or platform they already use. For instance, the mobile payment app Cash App, built on Marqeta's white-label card issuing platform, allows users to seamlessly buy, sell and store bitcoin, as well as receive their paychecks directly into their Cash App accounts. By outsourcing the development and maintenance of financial infrastructure to a white-label provider, businesses can reduce the time and resources required to bring new financial products to market. Ultimately, businesses can differentiate themselves, enhance customer loyalty and unlock new revenue streams. It's important to note that adopting white-label neobanking brings regulatory and security challenges. Compliance with complex frameworks like anti-money laundering (AML) rules, know your customer (KYC) requirements, and regulations under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is crucial, as failures can lead to fines and reputational damage. Security risks also persist; breaches in third-party systems can compromise sensitive data. A report from IBM noted that the average breach costs in 2024 is over $4.88 million with third-party vulnerabilities a major factor. Additionally, the risk of provider dependency looms large. Relying heavily on a single banking partner can lead to operational bottlenecks if the provider fails to scale or encounters financial instability. Diversifying partnerships or maintaining fallback systems can help mitigate such risks. The future of white-label neobanking is poised for substantial growth as businesses increasingly prioritize seamless financial integration. The banking-as-a-service (BaaS) market is projected to reach $65.95 billion by 2030, driven by rising demand for embedded finance across industries. Emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain will play pivotal roles in advancing white-label solutions. AI-powered analytics can help personalize financial products, improving customer engagement while blockchain enhances transparency in transactions. As white-label neobanking reshapes the financial services landscape, the challenges from security to compliance remain. However, a strategic approach to these innovations can continue enabling businesses to offer smarter, more secure and scalable financial services.

    "full_text": "More organizations around the world have been going to great lengths\u2014whether as required or on a voluntary basis\u2014 to disclose their sustainability/ESG practices and risks to customers and stakeholders. Now comes the hard part: taking definitive, concrete steps to strengthen those practices and mitigate those risks in the face of disparate regulatory frameworks in the regional, country and state jurisdictions within the organization\u2019s operating footprint. CSDDD: It\u2019s not too soon to get moving Enter the recently enacted Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) in the European Union (EU). While the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that took effect in January 2023 is primarily disclosure-oriented, the EU\u2019s CSDDD is all about action. CSDDD requires companies to perform due diligence on human rights and environmental risks within their operations and value chains. \u201cDue diligence\u201d entails identifying, preventing, mitigating and accounting for human rights and environmental risks. In-scope companies based in the EU and other global regions must begin complying with CSDDD new rules in July 2027. This timing begs the question: If these new rules go into effect more than two years from now, what\u2019s the rush in jumping on the compliance requirements now? The reason is that, in short, these requirements are a big deal, and it could take an organization two-plus years to establish the proper processes to comply with them. Specifically: And make no mistake, CSDDD compliance calls for the CFO\u2019s involvement and expertise just as much as, if not more than, CSRD compliance. Unlike CSRD, which requires transparency into environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices in the form of reports, CSDDD requires remediation and mitigation, with fines (up to 5% of global revenue) along with civil liabilities if violations are not corrected. Under CSDDD, businesses intent on operating in the EU must consider their upstream chain (e.g., raw material extraction and production) and, to a lesser extent, the downstream chain (e.g., channel partners and transportation to the end customer). As they assess the CSDDD requirements, CFOs should keep in mind the following key points. As I\u2019ve asserted, CFOs and finance teams are taking a lead role in orchestrating the organization\u2019s response to sustainability/ESG regulatory requirements. This should apply to CSDDD compliance, as well. As finance leaders craft a compliance game plan, they should take the following steps. Finance leaders also will want to leverage their expertise in regulatory reporting, control frameworks and validation processes, data governance, and audit trails (work that happens to be an ideal match for the CFO\u2019s designated ESG controller) to ensure that CSDDD mitigation and accounting actions are based on sound data-driven evidence. They will need to do the same when providing updates to investors and other interested parties on their progress toward CSDDD compliance as effective dates approach. By getting started on the substantial CSDDD orchestration effort today, CFOs will help their organizations avoid the heavy lifting and scrambles that have defined more than a few recent CSRD compliance efforts.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape industries, finance leaders are reaching a critical juncture, new research has claimed. A survey by Basware and Financial Times Longitude reveals while interest in AI remains high, scepticism over its measurable return on investment (ROI) is causing hesitation. Half of the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) surveyed reported they would reduce AI spending within a year if the results were not apparent. The survey, which gathered insights from 400 CFOs and finance leaders worldwide, found that 78% of organizations plan to increase their AI investments over the next 12 to 18 months. Many leaders acknowledge the potential of AI tools to transform financial operations, but nearly one-third (31%) admit their organizations lack a strategic vision for AI implementation. This lack of clarity is a major barrier, with 41% of finance leaders finding it difficult to prioritize AI investments amid broader macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Even major corporations, such as Meta have faced scrutiny over the challenges of proving ROI on substantial AI investments, reflecting broader industry concerns. Despite the hesitancy, the report highlights areas where AI is already yielding results. In finance, automation is seen as a way to reduce manual tasks, improve compliance, and detect errors or fraud more quickly. According to the survey, 75% of CFOs believe AI enables teams to focus on more strategic activities, such as regulatory compliance and e-invoicing. One promising application is accounts payable automation. Organizations that have prioritized AI in this area reported significant financial benefits, including a 136% ROI over three years. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! While the benefits of AI are clear, many organizations struggle with challenges related to change management and unclear strategy. The survey found that 40% of finance leaders cite inadequate change management capabilities as a key obstacle, while 31% believe a lack of strategic vision is hindering AI adoption in the finance function. \u201cThe office of the CFO is tasked with overseeing a complex range of functions from regulatory compliance through to cash flow management and financial reporting,\" noted Perttu Nihti, Chief Product Officer at Basware. \"All of which are areas where AI-powered automation can help to reduce hours and relieve pressure. But the success of AI investment hangs on knowing where to start and proving impact.\" \"We\u2019re at the AI tipping point.

    "full_text": "\u00d8yvind Forsbak, co-founder & CTO at Orient Software, a leading software outsourcing company that employs top software engineers from Vietnam   Data is driving innovation in today\u2019s finance industry. Financial institutions are sitting on enormous amounts of transaction histories, customer profiles, market trends and more. However, extracting actionable insights from such data is an ongoing challenge. With the banking sector earmarked for a 1,400% increase in generative AI spending between now and 2030, financial institutions are actively applying AI to reinvent the business model or sustain a competitive edge. As generative AI emerges, finance leaders are faced with a sea change in how they solve tough problems, think about new monetization pathways and dreams, and how to lead the game. Financial institutions are already adopting generative AI benefits, and these are getting up to scale at strategic levels. Often, traditional data analytics fail to uncover hidden patterns or accurately predict complex market behaviors from large datasets. Generative AI is a cutting-edge technology that has changed the game by providing advanced modeling and simulation tools that quickly extract actionable insights and forecast outcomes with unmatched precision. This major shift is transforming decision-making for financial leaders. Financial leaders benefit from generative AI\u2019s capability to simulate different market scenarios. This enables them to identify and mitigate risks early. Additionally, automated risk analysis powered by AI is needed to maintain resilience, particularly in a volatile market such as finance. AI is already reshaping customer service. Whether you own a small business or an enterprise, AI can revolutionize how you offer customer support with real-time, personalized experiences tailored to meet the customer\u2019s needs as they change. Generative AI does this by analyzing individual customer data to create hyper-personalized financial products and communication strategies. Not only that, it also boosts customer satisfaction and loyalty. A growing number of financial institutions are looking to GenAI to keep up with emerging fraud threats. Mastercard, for example, has deployed its own AI-based models to double the rate of discovering compromised cards and reduce false positives by 200%. This AI-driven approach swiftly blocks fraudulent activities and enhances overall fraud detection. Financial institutions can not only lower risks but also rapidly streamline regulatory compliance.  AI models continuously learning from real-time market data can help refine trading strategies for maximized profitability.  While generative AI certainly can change how financial institutions do business, its full adoption still poses challenges. \u2022 Fragmented and siloed datasets are a persistent issue in financial services. Generative AI comes in as a means to fill these gaps with realistic synthetic data to keep data integrity across operations. \u2022 Compliance is ever-changing, with new regulations going into effect all the time, so it can be resource-intensive and costly to maintain. AI-powered automated compliance workflows can minimize the risk of regulatory breaches by ensuring accuracy in documentation and processes. \u2022 Operational efficiency is also a significant consideration. If financial employees can automate routine tasks, they can concentrate on more strategic initiatives. Thus, operational costs will be reduced, and productivity will increase. \u2022 Another challenge is the talent shortage in AI expertise. Many financial institutions lack the in-house talent required to develop and implement AI solutions. If you are not looking to invest in building your own in-house expertise, turning to AI-as-a-service platforms or partnering with AI providers can help accelerate adoption. \u2022 Start small. Start with pilot programs to test AI\u2019s impact on specific areas before the full scale is tapped. It means resources are allocated to where they will deliver the most value. \u2022 Foster collaboration. Guarantee IT and business teams are aligned and bring together technical and industry expertise to successfully leverage AI technologies. \u2022 Establish data governance. As financial institutions work with sensitive customer data, data governance must be prioritized to ensure proper data protection, security and quality. \u2022 Partner with AI specialists. Working with experienced AI firms for collaboration helps the implementation be quick and compliant with industry standards so results come quickly. Financial institutions must stay on guard around ethical concerns when putting AI to work in finance. They must follow strict privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPA) to nurture customer trust and avoid penalties. Ensuring AI models are transparent and explainable fosters trust with both regulators and clients, making it easier to maintain compliance with industry standards. It is important to verify that no bias is circulated. Financial institutions must employ unbiased datasets for use in developing AI models and monitor them continuously to avoid discrimination. The potential for generative AI in finance is still unfolding. Looking ahead, we should expect more advanced applications, from real-time AI-driven financial advice to entirely new financial products designed for individual customers. From my perspective, the financial industry is just scratching the surface of generative AI. I foresee that within the next five years, AI-driven insights will be central to not only risk management but also product innovation, where real-time data will enable the creation of highly tailored financial products. Generative AI is set to be a transformative force in the financial industry, reshaping how institutions operate, innovate and compete. The question for financial leaders is no longer whether they should adopt AI but how swiftly and strategically they can integrate it to transform their operations. The future belongs to those who harness AI and act now to create solutions once unimaginable. In this constantly shifting landscape, AI will be the key differentiator that determines which organizations lead the industry forward. It is now or never to embrace generative AI. Those who do will shape the future of finance.  Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?"

    "full_text": "As the legal and technological landscape evolves, employers must remain agile, continuously ... [+] evaluating their policies and practices to align with emerging regulations and societal expectations. As 2025 begins, employers face a rapidly evolving landscape in hiring and background screening shaped by legislative developments, technological advancements, and emerging threats. Three key issues are poised to dominate the year: the advancement of clean slate laws, the growing adoption of fraudulent identities by threat actors, and the progression of artificial intelligence (AI) legislation. These trends underscore the importance of adaptability, compliance, and a proactive approach to mitigating risks while promoting equitable hiring practices. Clean slate laws are reshaping the way employers assess candidates by automatically sealing or expunging certain criminal records after a specified period. These laws aim to reduce the barriers individuals with criminal records face when seeking employment, fostering fairer hiring practices. By 2025, the clean slate movement is expected to accelerate, with more states enacting or expanding laws similar to those in Minnesota, Virginia, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., which were covered in my recent article, \"Clean Slate Laws 2025: Key Updates for Employers on Compliance and Hiring.\" The societal implications of these laws cannot be overstated. Millions of individuals with outdated or minor criminal records will gain access to broader employment opportunities, supporting economic growth and reducing recidivism rates. However, for employers, clean slate laws introduce compliance challenges, particularly for background screening. Employers must ensure their candidate-facing teams are prepared to discuss and assess the impact on adjudication during the transitional period between a clean slate law's effective date and the point when courts fully redact eligible criminal offenses from their indexes, which often leads to confusion for candidates with criminal histories who expect their records to be sealed or expunged. For example, candidates may mistakenly believe their records are sealed immediately upon the law's enactment and become frustrated when asked about offenses they expected would no longer appear. Preparing teams to explain the redaction process and offer reassurances can help mitigate misunderstandings and build trust with candidates during this transitional period. Additionally, these laws may lead to fewer criminal records being reported during background checks, prompting employers to reassess their hiring criteria. Employers should consider prioritizing other indicators of candidate suitability, such as qualifications, work experience, and skills. Employers must also remain vigilant in understanding the interplay between clean slate laws and industries requiring rigorous compliance, such as healthcare, education, and finance. To supplement these efforts, employers could explore lawful and ethical social media searches, focusing only on publicly available information that complies with applicable privacy laws. This approach offers another dimension to candidate assessment while respecting legal boundaries and maintaining trust. The rise of remote and hybrid work models has created unprecedented challenges in verifying the identity of candidates. In 2025, threat actors are expected to increasingly adopt fraudulent identities to infiltrate organizations, whether to commit financial fraud, steal intellectual property, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems. As I discussed in a recent piece, the emergence of \"fake workers\" is not a hypothetical risk\u2014it\u2019s a reality that employers can no longer afford to ignore. Conducting robust identity verifications will be essential for mitigating this growing threat. Employers should leverage advanced identity verification technologies that provide robust and reliable validation. Utilizing digital solutions that incorporate AI-driven Optical Character Recognition ensures that identity documents are authentic and align with the personal information provided by candidates. Anti-spoofing liveness technology can confirm that the individual undergoing verification is physically present, while biometric face matching ensures that the candidate\u2019s facial features match their photo identification. These technologies not only enhance the accuracy of identity verifications but also reduce the risk of fraudulent activity, safeguarding the integrity of the hiring process while maintaining compliance with data protection standards. While technology plays a vital role in mitigating these threats, it must be complemented by education and awareness initiatives for hiring teams. Employers must integrate identity verification into every stage of the hiring process, from initial application to onboarding. HR professionals should be trained to identify red flags associated with fraudulent identities, such as inconsistencies in application materials or the use of synthetic identifiers. These efforts will help organizations safeguard their workforce and maintain trust in their hiring processes. Artificial intelligence continues to play an increasingly prominent role in hiring, with applications ranging from resume screening to candidate assessments. However, AI-related legislation is advancing rapidly, focusing on critical decisions made by AI. Employers using AI-driven tools must tread carefully to ensure compliance with emerging laws while avoiding discriminatory outcomes. In 2025, we can expect more states to generally follow Illinois' HB 3773 and Colorado's regulations, which require bias audits and transparency in AI decision-making. These laws aim to address concerns that AI could unintentionally perpetuate systemic discrimination if not properly monitored. As I emphasized in my articles on AI in employment, existing anti-discrimination laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, remain highly relevant in this context. Employers must ensure that their AI tools are not making decisions based on protected characteristics, even indirectly. This regulatory trend extends beyond hiring decisions to include AI tools used in ongoing worker monitoring and management. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recently issued rules requiring employers to ensure transparency and fairness in AI systems that monitor employee productivity or performance. These rules signal a growing expectation that employers proactively address potential biases and provide clarity on how AI systems evaluate workers throughout their employment lifecycle. To navigate this evolving landscape, organizations should prioritize using AI tools designed to facilitate processes rather than make autonomous decisions. For instance, automating tasks such as scheduling interviews or generating follow-up emails is less likely to raise compliance concerns than relying on AI to make autonomous hiring or promotion decisions. Furthermore, employers must develop comprehensive AI compliance frameworks that extend beyond hiring. These frameworks should account for how AI tools are used in employee evaluations, promotions, and disciplinary actions. Employers should partner with trusted vendors who can demonstrate that their AI solutions meet regulatory requirements and adhere to fairness and transparency standards. As these three trends converge in 2025, the stakes for employers have never been higher. Compliance with clean slate laws will require meticulous attention to detail and an openness to adopting more holistic hiring criteria. Protecting against identity fraud will demand investment in cutting-edge verification technologies and processes. Adapting to AI legislation will necessitate a balance between leveraging innovation and ensuring fairness. As the legal and technological landscape evolves, employers must remain agile, continuously evaluating their policies and practices to align with emerging regulations and societal expectations. By staying ahead of these trends, employers can turn challenges into opportunities and thrive in the face of change. At the same time, they will contribute to a more inclusive and secure workforce, benefiting both their organizations and society at large.  One Community.

    "full_text": "Parvez Siddiqui is cofounder of TrustIn Limited, a regulated and global digital escrow platform, and an advocate for inclusive finance.   Trust has always been essential to commerce. Silk Road traders, for example, needed intermediaries to guarantee that merchandise went one way and payments went another. As the world grows and develops and technology advances at a rapid rate, trust remains the catalyst for a functioning global society. Where a payment process would once take weeks to finalize and delicately navigate, payments can now be made with a literal click of a button. Parties never even have to encounter one another. But in this arrangement, how does one ensure trust? Digital escrow is one tool that aims to help answer this question. This is the process by which an unbiased third-party agent holds cash or a title and only releases the payment or item due when a contract has been thoroughly fulfilled. As the cofounder of a digital escrow platform, I believe that as this market evolves, it needs to address complications while developing a tactical plan for maximum expansion. Digital escrow is a relatively easy concept: An impartial third party holds funds or property until specified rules are achieved. Here's how it works: \u2022 Conditions established: The buyer and seller determine the agreement, what will be provided, payment, etc. \u2022 Payment made: The buyer places payment in the escrow account as a show of good faith. \u2022 Services rendered: The seller provides the product/service as required. \u2022 Payment released: The buyer acknowledges satisfaction and approves the release to the seller. A key development in digital escrow today is the use of virtual accounts. These accounts can be created depending on the transaction, like an account just for a real estate purchase or supply purchase. Virtual accounts can also provide visibility, so buyers and sellers can see where the funds are at any time and cross-border flexibility. The ability to function in different currencies can make international transactions simpler. Digital escrow is used in various sectors, such as e-commerce. In an industry that reached $5.8 trillion in retail sales in 2023 alone, some e-commerce platforms are using digital escrow to help give buyers and sellers more peace of mind until the transaction is complete. Digital escrow can also be used in real estate, supply chain financing and crowdfunding, something I've seen firsthand through my company's work. Luxury goods and collectibles are another example; sometimes, digital escrow is used to secure transactions involving rare items like art, high-end jewelry and cars. Global digital escrow services must navigate diverse anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements, which can vary significantly across jurisdictions. Missteps can be costly, as global non-compliance fines exceeded $4 billion in 2022, according to the Reading Between the Fines Report by Fenergo (registration required). Opportunities for leaders: \u2022 Partner with regulators. Build relationships with regulatory bodies to help foster trust and compliance with local and international standards. \u2022 Explore automation for compliance. AI and machine learning can streamline AML/KYC checks, which can help reduce errors and adapt to evolving regulations. Digital escrow platforms are prime targets for cyberattacks due to the sensitive financial data they handle. A breach could compromise funds and erode user trust. This year, the average cost of a data breach globally increased by 10% to $4.88 million, according to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report (registration required). Opportunities for leaders: \u2022 Embed cybersecurity by design. Ensure you're using advanced encryption, multifactor authentication and secure application programming interfaces to help protect platforms from breaches. \u2022 Consider blockchain technology. Blockchain technology can help enhance cybersecurity in digital escrow by creating immutable transaction records that are transparent and tamper-proof. Depending on the type of blockchain used, even the escrow platform itself may not be able to change the transaction guidelines or terms and conditions of the escrow transaction because that will be saved securely in the blockchain. While my company uses traditional cybersecurity measures, we are working on a blockchain solution to further secure user data and escrow transaction conditions. For companies looking to do something similar and integrate blockchain, starting with a clear identification of relevant use cases, such as transaction verification or fraud prevention, is key. From there, you can partner with experienced blockchain platforms to ensure a successful implementation. The future of digital escrow lies at the intersection of technology and trust. Innovative tools and global standardization will shape the industry\u2019s trajectory. 1. Use of blockchain: I believe the potential of blockchain technology for tracing and verifying escrowed funds could be transformative for the digital escrow space. The blockchain market as a whole is projected to reach $825 billion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights. 2. AI-driven compliance: Automation could transform compliance and regulatory efforts, as well as help reduce human error. 3. Standardization across the globe: I expect to see new global regulations and compliance standards for digital escrow in the future, especially since I anticipate cross-border transactions to become more commonplace. To avoid becoming obsolete, companies should conduct compliance audits regularly and establish internal structures to assess new regulations prior to relaying compliance training to employees and clients. Understanding who the leaders in the industry are and tracking governmental regulatory agencies can keep a company apprised when changes do occur so compliance can be adjusted seamlessly. Trust is the new currency, and I believe digital escrow will become more common in transactions worldwide. If current challenges\u2014like regulatory hurdles and cybersecurity risks\u2014can be worked out, the integration of technologies like blockchain could position digital escrow as a transformative solution in the global marketplace.

    "full_text": "Erum Manzoor is Senior Vice President\u2014Global Wealth Technology of Citigroup and thought leader, Linkedin Top Voice, author and speaker.   AI is massively reshaping the financial world, but fully integrating this technology is burdensome and expensive. As Citi explained in a recent report, AI will profoundly change the future of finance and money, and \"it could potentially drive global banking industry profits to $2 trillion by 2028, a 9% increase over the next five years.\" Heavyweights such as Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Capitol One, among others, have committed to AI investments for gains in efficiencies, enhanced customer experience and enhanced risk assessment. However, behind the headlines, companies face tough regulations, an entangled web of legacy systems and the creation of customer-ready solutions that continue to pose major challenges. Financial institutions are among the most regulated environments on the planet, and the deployment of AI introduces troublesome compliance issues that are becoming increasingly strict by the year. Within the European Union, for example, heavy fines under the General Data Protection Regulation have been levied against organizations for mishandling consumer data. Each serious breach could amount to a fine of up to 4% of a company's global revenue. Similarly, with the AI Act, the EU classifies AI applications according to risk, placing financial applications like credit scoring or fraud detection under the \"high-risk\" category. That means more disclosures, auditing and explainability\u2014each of which adds more compliance and administration. In the U.S., state-by-state data privacy laws are either proposed or already in place\u2014such as the CCPA and the NYDFS Part 500 regulation. This is a fragmented regulatory landscape that forces banks into region-specific AI protocols, driving up implementation costs and elongating the timescale required to fully implement AI-driven services. Most banks, as well as insurance and asset management companies, have big investments in legacy infrastructure\u2014in many cases, going back decades. Although still operational, older systems are often not structured for the heavy computation loads or complex data analytics that are required by AI. Deloitte points out that many financial institutions still rely on core operations managed through mainframe-based infrastructure. With this infrastructure, in general, AI requires extensive and expensive workarounds for integration. As McKinsey pointed out in a 2021 report, legacy systems \"often lack the capacity and flexibility required to support the variable computing requirements, data-processing needs, and real-time analysis that closed-loop AI applications require.\" Most smaller institutions cannot afford bespoke repairs to update their systems, meaning access to scaleable AI remains beyond them and is deepening a technological divide between global players and regional banks. Legacy systems also use incompatible data formats, which create difficulties for AI algorithms to operate on existing information. One challenge, for instance, is if AI tools often cannot access siloed customer data from operations around the organization, which can significantly limit a model's effectiveness. This lack of interoperability generally results in fragmentations of AI systems that cannot reach the complete dataset required for their accuracy. In such cases, AI fails to live up to its pledge of allowing advanced customer personalization and risk analytics. Creating customer-ready solutions using AI presents a host of different challenges. For financial firms, usability, scalability and building customer trust are a few of the major concerns if the technology is to see widespread acceptance. For example, AI-powered customer-service bots are multiplying but have variously suffered from everything from minimal capability to resolve problems to subpar hand-offs with human agents. Meanwhile, perfecting those tools to deliver seamless customer experiences reliably remains an uphill task: According to a SurveyMonkey report, \"61% of consumers say humans understand their needs better than AI.\" But banks are aware of this issue. According to a report from EY-Parthenon, 60% of banks are implementing GenAI to make customer experience enhancements\u2014one of the greatest motivators to implement the technology, second only to productivity enhancements. The lack of transparency is also an issue. This is especially true of applications related to credit assessment and investment advice, among others, where a lack of transparency could cloud any decision and affect bottom-line financial outcomes. The drive toward explainable AI (XAI), an expensive undertaking wherein most systems do a lot more than carry out complex computations, also explains those decisions in clear, simple language. And add to this the talent shortage that plagues the industry. A report by Rivel Banking found that \"80% of community banks and credit unions list staffing as their biggest concern.\" Even for institutions with moderately sufficient budgets, the recruitment and retention of talent to construct AI solutions is hard to find. These challenges underpin the truism that while AI can transform finance, the potential will be realized only with more than just technological investment. This involves several structural and strategic changes, ranging from regulatory harmonization to the gradual replacement of legacy systems. Until then, AI in finance remains an elite tool available to a few institutions\u2014which are capable and willing to meet the financial, regulatory and operational demands. For the rest, the transformative promise of AI will continue to remain out of grasp. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

    "full_text": "Decentralized Finance (DeFI) is at a crossroads (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) A legal battle in Texas could shape the future of decentralized finance (DeFi), as innovators challenge the IRS and Treasury\u2019s controversial \u201cbroker\u201d rule, highlighting a pivotal moment for regulation and innovation in the U.S. There\u2019s a saying in the Lone Star State: Don\u2019t mess with Texas. Living there, I quickly learned that this wasn\u2019t just a catchphrase; it was a reflection of the state\u2019s fierce independence and pride. Texas, with its vast landscapes and resilient spirit, has long been a place where individuals and businesses have thrived on the principles of freedom and self-reliance. Like so many who have been lucky to live in the state, I appreciated the culture of entrepreneurship and the ability to innovate without the heavy hand of regulation. Texas, home of the Texas Blockchain Council (Photo by Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images) So, when news broke that the DeFi Education Fund, the Blockchain Association, and the Texas Blockchain Council filed a lawsuit challenging the IRS and Treasury Department\u2019s final \u201cbroker\u201d rule making, it hit me in a way that felt deeply personal. The very same state I had once called home, famous for fighting to keep regulation at bay, was now at the heart of a legal battle against a rule that many believe could stifle innovation in one of the most groundbreaking industries of our time: decentralized finance (DeFi). The digital asset industry, a sector marked by rapid innovation and decentralization, finds itself at the center of this legal battle, sparked by the IRS and Treasury Department\u2019s controversial final \u201cbroker\u201d rulemaking. On December 27, 2024, the DeFi Education Fund, the Blockchain Association, and the Texas Blockchain Council filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Their claim: the rule exceeds the statutory authority of the IRS and Treasury, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and is unconstitutional. This case isn\u2019t just about a technical legal issue; it\u2019s a reflection of the tension between the regulatory frameworks of traditional financial systems and the disruptive force of new technologies like decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi, by design, operates without a central authority, enabling individuals to engage in financial activities\u2014such as lending, borrowing, and trading\u2014without relying on intermediaries like banks. It\u2019s this very decentralization that makes DeFi so revolutionary; it\u2019s also what makes it so attractive to a state that\u2019s always prized freedom and rugged individualism. Of course, those same qualities make central government and regulators incredibly nervous of ceding to control. At the core of this dispute lies a critical question: how should decentralized technologies be regulated? And, more importantly, how can regulators ensure that innovation continues without undermining the very principles of decentralization that DeFi embodies? The stakes in this case couldn\u2019t be higher. If the IRS and Treasury rule stands, it could create a regulatory framework that doesn\u2019t simply stifle innovation but potentially drives developers and entrepreneurs overseas. For the DeFi Education Fund, the Blockchain Association, and the Texas Blockchain Council, this is about more than just legal arguments. It\u2019s about protecting a nascent industry from a potentially calamitous act of sabotage. The global blockchain revolution is too big and far too advanced to lose sleep over the \u201cbroker\u201d rule. It does, however, have a huge bearing on whether Texas (and by extension, the U.S.) continues to play a major, leading role in reshaping the financial landscape for the better. Marisa Coppel, Head of Legal for the Blockchain Association Marisa Coppel, Head of Legal for the Blockchain Association, argues that the rule\u2019s broad definition of a \"broker\" threatens to push innovation out of the U.S. \"The IRS and Treasury have gone beyond their statutory authority in expanding the definition of \u2018broker\u2019 to include providers of DeFi trading front-ends even though they do not affect transactions,\" Coppel said. \"This not only infringes on the privacy rights of individuals using decentralized technology, but it also risks pushing this entire burgeoning technology offshore.\" My fondest memories of Texas are from working with some of the brightest minds in the tech space. We were always looking for ways to innovate, to push boundaries, to create something that would not only stand out but also help shape the future. It\u2019s clear that the plaintiffs in this case are deeply concerned about the future of innovation in the U.S. \"We are incredibly disappointed in today\u2019s decision by the Treasury and the IRS to finalize the misguided and unfairly sweeping DeFi portion of their \u2018broker\u2019 rulemaking,\" said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund. \"Decentralized Finance promises to make financial services and the digital economy more accessible, efficient, interoperable, dependable, and consumer-focused. This promise is at the heart of our work at the DeFi Education Fund. This unfortunate rulemaking is a direct threat to financial innovation, and we intend to fight it using every tool available to us.\" Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council The challenges of regulating DeFi are very real. The rule\u2019s provisions impose unrealistic compliance expectations on decentralized platforms that simply do not have the kind of centralized structure required to meet these demands. \"The rule fails to recognize the decentralized nature of this technology,\" said Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council. \"Many actors simply do not have access to the information the IRS is now demanding. This regulatory overreach risks driving critical development overseas, threatening U.S. competitiveness in the digital economy.\" A notable example of the tension between innovation and regulation in decentralized finance (DeFi) involves the platform Uniswap. Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain, enables users to trade cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, embodying the core principles of DeFi. Its open-access model and automated liquidity provision have been hailed as significant innovations in the financial sector. However, Uniswap's decentralized nature has also attracted scrutiny from regulators concerned about issues such as money laundering, fraud, and investor protection. The lack of traditional oversight mechanisms in DeFi platforms like Uniswap poses challenges for regulatory bodies attempting to enforce compliance and ensure market integrity. This situation exemplifies the broader debate within the DeFi ecosystem: how to balance the drive for financial innovation and inclusivity with the necessity of regulatory frameworks that protect users and maintain systemic stability. Achieving this balance is crucial for the sustainable growth of DeFi platforms and their integration into the mainstream financial system. The implications of this case stretch far beyond the digital asset sector. The growing prominence of blockchain technology and decentralized finance forces regulators to confront an increasingly complex question: How can you regulate something that operates outside of traditional systems of control? Blockchain, by its very nature, defies traditional models of regulation. This isn\u2019t just about the future of DeFi; it\u2019s about how we, as a society, understand and interact with technology that doesn\u2019t rely on central authorities to function. Can we strike a balance between protecting consumers and ensuring that innovation continues to thrive? Blockchain is a decentralized, secure digital ledger that records transactions transparently and ... [+] immutably across a network of computers. For me, the question of regulation in emerging technologies hits home. I have always believed that the best way to innovate is to allow ideas to grow organically, without the constraints of overregulation. I saw firsthand how Silicon Valley, Austin, and other tech hubs thrived under conditions that allowed ideas to flourish without excessive government intervention. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it worked. The regulatory uncertainty created by the IRS\u2019s rule could put that entire ecosystem at risk, potentially forcing talent and investment to flow elsewhere. This lawsuit against the IRS and Treasury is about more than just a legal challenge\u2014it\u2019s about the future of an industry that has the potential to fundamentally change how we interact with financial systems. It\u2019s about ensuring that the U.S. remains a global leader in technological innovation, rather than stifling that innovation through overly burdensome regulation. If this case is successful, it could provide much-needed clarity and protection for the digital asset industry, allowing it to grow and evolve in a way that remains true to the decentralized principles that make it so transformative. Regulatory clarity brings confidence. Conversely, if the IRS\u2019s rule stands, it could create a chilling effect on innovation. Developers may be forced to comply with unreasonable requirements that not only slow down progress but potentially push talented teams and entrepreneurs to more forward-thinking jurisdictions (where, believe me, they will be welcomed with open arms!). We could see a repeat of what happened in other sectors, where regulatory uncertainty led to a drain of talent and investment. For the U.S., ceding this leadership would be a strategic disaster. This lawsuit is not just about a single rule; it\u2019s about defining the future of financial innovation in a rapidly changing world. How we choose to regulate DeFi, blockchain, and other emerging technologies will shape the trajectory of the digital economy for years to come. This legal battle may very well determine whether the U.S. continues to be a leader in innovation or whether we risk falling behind in the race to define the future of finance. If regulators insist on ploughing ahead with their heavy-handed law, they\u2019ll have an almighty fight on their hands. They may find out what many others also learned the hard way: Don\u2019t mess with Texas. At its core, this dispute highlights a deeper question around innovation. How can governments regulate technologies that challenge traditional models of control and centralization? Striking the right balance between oversight and innovation is crucial not just for DeFi but for all emerging technologies. The outcome of this case will set a precedent for how the U.S. approaches regulation in the digital economy. Will the courts uphold the rule, potentially stifling a sector with transformative potential? Or will they rein in regulatory overreach, paving the way for a more innovation-friendly environment? As stakeholders on both sides prepare for what promises to be a landmark legal battle, the stakes for the future of decentralized finance\u2014and America\u2019s role in it\u2014could not be higher.

    "full_text": "The European Union\u2019s compliance and voluntary carbon markets, as they currently stand, cannot sustainably fund carbon-removal technologies. But policymakers can use regulation, such as requiring firms to purchase negative emissions credits, to promote investment and deployment of this green solution across the bloc.  BERLIN/PARIS \u2013 The European Union has committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and there are strong signals that EU policymakers will approve a new target to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040. The science is clear on what must be done to limit global warming to 1.5\u00ba Celsius above preindustrial levels: rapid and dramatic cuts in emissions and the removal of 6-10 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually. And yet the former receives far more attention than the latter.   This must change \u2013 and fast. Removal of atmospheric CO2 will require scaling up investment in carbon-removal technologies from $5-13 billion today to $6-16 trillion by 2050. For comparison, this is at least double the amount of revenues generated by the oil and gas industry each year.   Setting aside the moral \u2013 one could say existential \u2013 obligation to protect the climate, there is a business case for deploying carbon-removal technology across the EU. By 2050, a global carbon-removal industry capable of achieving net-zero emissions could be worth between $300 billion and $1.2 trillion.   Besides private- and public-sector investments, carbon markets \u2013 where companies purchase credits to offset their emissions \u2013 have emerged as one of the most important sources of finance for carbon-removal projects. By putting a price on carbon, businesses are incentivized to improve energy efficiency and develop and deploy green solutions across their operations.   Today, there are two main approaches to carbon pricing: compliance and voluntary carbon markets. The compliance market is regulated by mandatory carbon-reduction regimes, mainly targeting high-emitting industries such as steel, oil, and transportation, while the voluntary market operates independently, without direct regulatory oversight.   The EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System (ETS), the bloc\u2019s compliance market, works on a cap-and-trade principle, whereby firms in specific sectors receive emission allowances, the supply of which is capped at a level that reduces total CO2 emissions. They can sell unused allowances on the market, often to companies that require additional ones.  At a time when democracy is under threat, there is an urgent need for incisive, informed analysis of the issues and questions driving the news \u2013 just what PS has always provided. Subscribe now and save $50 on a new subscription. \nSubscribe Now\n  By contrast, voluntary carbon markets allow businesses and individuals to purchase credits from verified offset projects in order to meet sustainability goals independently from any emission allowances. These markets use different methodologies to ensure that the emissions reductions are real, measurable, and permanent.   Unfortunately, despite the urgency of climate action, recent debates about voluntary carbon markets have cast doubt on their usefulness.\u00a0Skeptics argue that the lack of transparency and inconsistent standards lead to low-quality credits based on offsets that fail to deliver the promised emissions reductions. In their view, these markets allow large companies to engage in a sophisticated form of greenwashing.   The controversy came to a head earlier this year, when naysayers questioned the legitimacy of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which develops the global standards and tools that enable companies to set GHG targets in line with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The SBTi\u2019s decision to allow firms to include voluntary carbon credits in the calculation of their indirect emissions triggered a significant backlash, with many challenging the credibility of such instruments. A few months later, the SBTi revised its position, clarifying that environmental attribute certificates \u2013 including carbon credits \u2013 cannot be used to offset a company\u2019s value-chain emissions.   These developments have held up critical financing for climate solutions \u2013 especially carbon removal. Neither the EU ETS nor the bloc\u2019s voluntary carbon markets can sustainably fund carbon-removal technologies. Many have suggested using advanced technology to improve the transparency and accountability of carbon markets. But given the situation\u2019s complexity and the lack of unified voluntary standards, scaling up carbon removal requires another tool: regulation.   Japan serves as a good example. The country\u2019s compliance carbon market now accepts credits from carbon-removal methods, including direct air capture and bioenergy carbon capture and storage.\u00a0California\u2019s Carbon Dioxide Removal Market Development Act could likewise foster the widespread adoption and deployment of this technology by defining which types of emissions it can counterbalance.   The EU should require companies to reduce emissions to a certain threshold and purchase \u201cnegative emissions credits\u201d to compensate for their remaining climate impact. Equally important, clear rules for certifying carbon-removal practices to ensure their effectiveness and long-term storage will incentivize businesses to invest in these technologies.   Some progress has already been made. The EU\u2019s adoption of the carbon removals certification framework this year was an important first step toward regulating this technology.   But more must be done. For starters, it is unclear how this new framework will work with existing regulations, including the ETS. Moreover, standards-setting organizations such as the SBTi must better integrate \u201cbeyond value chain mitigation\u201d \u2013 a firm\u2019s efforts to reduce GHG emissions outside of its own business activities \u2013 and carbon removal into short-term corporate climate targets to help guide the regulatory response. As the EU prepares to revise the ETS in 2026, it must take advantage of this opportunity to take the lead in promoting a crucial green technology.

    "full_text": "Gary Galstyan is Founder/CEO Accountant at Rockwell Capital Group and an expert in accounting and tax services.   As the founder and CEO of a financial and accounting services firm, I\u2019ve learned firsthand that the best approach to accounting is being proactive, not reactive. Unfortunately, many companies only seek accounting support after problems have surfaced\u2014whether it\u2019s a cash flow crunch, tax complications or compliance issues. By then, the financial strain has often taken a toll, making it difficult and costly to undo the damage. Proactive accounting is far more than balancing books and filing tax returns. It\u2019s about foreseeing potential issues and establishing preventive measures to secure your business\u2019s finances. Below are the key areas where a proactive approach can significantly impact your business\u2019s financial health. One major advantage of proactive accounting lies in managing cash flow effectively. Cash flow issues frequently cause financial distress for companies, yet with the right planning and insight, these problems can often be avoided entirely. Take, for example, a client of ours who had consistent revenue but encountered liquidity challenges. We examined their accounts receivable and noted a pattern of delayed client payments. By implementing a structured billing system and closely monitoring cash flow forecasts, we helped them avoid future cash shortfalls. By proactively managing their cash flow, they were able to sidestep liquidity crises that would have hindered daily operations. Managing taxes effectively requires a year-round approach, not just a once-a-year rush. Proactive accounting includes planning well ahead of tax deadlines, maximizing deductions and finding credits that many companies might miss with a reactive approach. For example, one business owner we worked with initially thought they had their tax strategy in check. However, when we reviewed their financials more closely, we uncovered a range of industry-specific deductions they had overlooked. By incorporating these deductions into their annual tax plan, they saved thousands. This proactive tax planning created ongoing savings, offering the client a structured tax approach they could rely on every year. In my experience, regulatory compliance is one of the biggest areas where businesses can rack up unnecessary costs. Regulatory requirements\u2014from payroll to sales tax\u2014are constantly shifting, and failing to stay current with these changes can lead to hefty fines and erode trust with stakeholders. Financial data should be a tool for insight, not just a reflection of past performance. Proactive accounting enables you to analyze your business\u2019s financial data in real time, helping you make informed decisions. One client, for example, was considering a major investment in new equipment. By proactively reviewing their financial forecasts and evaluating financing options, they avoided unnecessary debt by adjusting their budget. This proactive approach allowed them to pursue growth without stretching their cash flow or tapping into reserves, enabling sustainable expansion. Fraud and errors in financial records often go unnoticed when businesses operate with a reactive approach to accounting. Once these issues come to light, they can be complex to untangle and may harm a company\u2019s reputation. With proactive accounting, regular checks and audits are part of the ongoing financial process, catching any discrepancies or unusual activity early. In one case, our audits revealed unauthorized expenses that had slipped through the cracks for months. We helped the business owner correct the course and put preventive controls in place. Proactive monitoring can stop fraud before it starts and ensure internal accountability. While a proactive accounting approach helps you prevent costly errors, it also reduces the stress and time commitment that accounting tasks often demand during busy seasons. Continuous financial upkeep makes year-end reporting and tax preparation much smoother. It can also free up time to focus on growing your business during peak season. A proactive approach to your business\u2019s accounting should include the following: \u2022 Cash flow management: Regularly review cash flow forecasts (weekly or biweekly) and monitor accounts receivable to avoid liquidity issues. Implement structured billing practices so you get paid on time. \u2022 Tax planning: Conduct quarterly tax reviews to maximize deductions and identify industry-specific credits. Maintain updated tax strategies to optimize savings and prevent last-minute rushes. \u2022 Compliance monitoring: Stay informed on regulatory changes by reviewing compliance requirements monthly, including payroll and sales tax. Implement systems that automatically update for legal changes to avoid fines. \u2022 Financial analysis: Perform monthly financial reviews, focusing on key performance indicators and profitability. Use real-time data to inform strategic decisions and avoid unnecessary risks. \u2022 Fraud prevention: Conduct internal audits quarterly to catch discrepancies early. Establish preventive controls, such as segregation of duties, to minimize errors and fraud risks. \u2022 Recordkeeping: Maintain accurate, up-to-date records throughout the year, which will simplify your year-end reporting. Proactive accounting establishes a solid financial foundation that supports sustainable growth, minimizes risks and enhances strategic decision making. Businesses often don\u2019t realize the real cost of a reactive approach to accounting until it\u2019s too late and past mistakes come back to bite. Staying ahead on your accounting empowers you to operate with confidence and control over your finances. In an unpredictable business world, embracing a proactive accounting strategy is essential for maintaining resilience and readiness for the financial challenges that lie ahead.

    "full_text": "Shivali Kukreja, Head of Risk & Compliance, nib New Zealand: Driving Customer-Centric Innovation & Strategic Impact in Financial Services.   Risk management should not just be a checklist to be compliant. Rather, it should be a source of value, inextricably tied to your business strategy. Purpose-driven and customer-centric risk management does more than just protect; it propels growth and innovation. With over 23 years of leadership experience, I have transformed risk and compliance functions within complex organizations, integrating them seamlessly into business strategies to drive customer-focused innovation and growth. As the Head of Risk & Compliance at nib New Zealand, I champion a proactive and value-driven approach to risk, emphasizing fairness, sustainability and customer-centric outcomes. Here is how to transform risk management into a strategic advantage through five steps. Objective: Shift risk management from a transactional oversight role to a core values-driven function focusing on accountability, transparency and customer-centricity. Approach: Define a specific mission for your risk management group that embeds purpose in all activities. This is more than about processes; it\u2019s about creating trust and ownership within your organization. Everyone should be empowered to speak up, solve root causes of issues and behave in an ethical manner in keeping with the company\u2019s mission. Example: The top must set the right example, including the board, CEO and senior leaders, by embodying a culture of transparency and ethics. Equip employees with tools and frameworks to take confident, values-driven actions. For example, we\u2019ve built a board-level risk appetite statement dashboard to transform risk management. It\u2019s a strategic enabler, aligning all risk types\u2014strategic, financial and nonfinancial\u2014with the overall enterprise risk profile. Fully integrated, it drives transparency and accountability across the organization. Metrics ownership ensures swift action on those outside tolerance. Using leading and lagging indicators\u2014key performance indicators, key risk indicators and key control indicators\u2014alongside a red-amber-green methodology, the dashboard provides real-time risk insights. Continuous improvement keeps it relevant to evolving needs and regulatory expectations. Beyond compliance, it creates value, fosters a proactive risk culture and enables smarter decisions that build resilience and fuel growth. Objective: Make sure risk frameworks are aligned with your business\u2019s strategy for making risk decisions that would facilitate growth with proper exposure management. Approach: Get a clear understanding of your organization\u2019s direction, and align the risk appetite with that vision. Insert risk assessment into each strategic decision\u2014from product launches to mergers to technology-driven transformations\u2014to make well-rounded choices. Continuously monitor risks and resilience to effect necessary changes based on market fluctuations, competitive pressures or regulatory development. Example: Place risk at the heart of every strategic decision. Model various real-world disruptions that could occur, and test resilience in areas such as supply chains, technology or regulatory changes. The result is an organization ready for uncertainty; each building block opens the door to greater strategic agility. Objective: To reposition the outlook of risk management toward value creation for customers through just and open processes that cultivate trust. Approach: Establish how risk impacts customer experience, and take positive steps to minimize those risks. Map the entire customer journey, then develop risk frameworks that maintain trust at every touchpoint in acquisition and retention. Example: Implementing a customer feedback monitoring tool at every interaction point allows organizations to capture real-time insights from complaints, service interactions and satisfaction scores. This data becomes a powerful resource for proactively identifying risks and uncovering opportunities for improvement. For example, recurring feedback about delays in processing claims might reveal a systemic issue within an internal workflow. By analyzing the data, the root cause can be identified, enabling teams to collaborate on refining processes and implementing streamlined solutions to enhance efficiency. Beyond addressing immediate issues, this kind of feedback loop can inspire broader enhancements, such as improving digital platforms for greater accessibility and user-friendliness. This approach mitigates risk while strengthening customer trust and loyalty. By turning feedback into actionable insights, organizations can foster continuous improvement and deliver better outcomes for their customers. Objective: To provide the organization with technology that transforms data into insight and insights into action so the risk function can be truly responsive/agile. Approach: Invest in predictive analytics, AI, etc., but select carefully. The technology should augment human insight, not replace it, and evolve with your organization\u2019s needs. Scalable and flexible systems should be put in place, which will handle holistic risks, from operational threats to third-party and cybersecurity risks. Example: Use AI-driven insights to predict trends and identify vulnerabilities before they affect operations. Train teams to use tools effectively and understand their strategic importance. AI can forecast financial performance, improve quality assurance, detect fraud and personalize financial advice. By embedding AI in critical functions, organizations turn insights into actionable strategies, optimize budgets, enhance customer outcomes and proactively mitigate threats. This approach reduces risks and drives resilience and competitiveness in a dynamic business environment. Objective: Make the risk management framework flexible. Approach: Regularly review your framework to update changes due to new risks, regulatory changes and customer expectations. Embed resilience into your risk approach rather than making it just a one-off initiative. Example: Rapidly gear up for changed customer behavior and/or regulation requirements. Periodically test and refine risk frameworks to ensure they address current challenges and allow the organization to maintain agility. Incorporate insights from post-incident reviews to identify gaps and drive improvements. When risk management becomes a strategic differentiator, it ceases being about protecting your business but about driving growth, innovation and customer confidence. Harmonizing intentions with actual actions, embedding risk into strategic planning and exploiting technology effectively\u2014all that plays a major role in shifting risk management from being a compliance need to one that really makes a difference. This perspective, coupled with a culture of resilience and a customer-oriented approach, can propel sustainable success and help reimagine how your organization creates value. Risk management isn\u2019t just a must; this is an opportunity to lead, adjust and thrive.

    "full_text": "Lior Lamesh is the Co-founder and CEO of GK8, a Galaxy company.   Customers have trusted banks with custody of their assets for centuries, believing a bank vault is safer than keeping wealth under the mattress. As digital assets gain value and adoption increases, particularly in light of an incoming administration promising favorable regulatory change, the need for robust custody solutions remains vital. Whether you\u2019re a traditional financial institution or a crypto-native, understanding how to protect significant digital wealth is crucial. This article breaks down the digital custody technology evaluation process into five clear steps for making an informed decision: Security is paramount in digital asset custody. Your custody solution must provide robust protection against theft. It should pass cybersecurity tests\u2014penetration testing, vulnerability scanning and security audits\u2014while also undergoing social engineering and physical security assessments. Consider the DMM hack: Despite the Japanese regulations that require a percentage of assets to be kept in cold storage, over $300 million was stolen. The damage to a financial institution\u2019s reputation after a breach? Irreversible. \"Secure enough\" isn\u2019t good enough when it comes to public funds; hacks are not an option. If you want absolute trust, you need a custody solution that guarantees no connectivity for bad actors. To ensure your assets are genuinely theft-proof, adopt a custody solution that remains offline all the time. Cold and warm solutions serve operational purposes, but only unequivocally impenetrable custody, with encrypted one-way communication and zero digital input, offers true security. Ideally, you want to balance the security of wholly offline custody with day-to-day operational accessibility. The regulatory landscape for digital asset custody is rapidly evolving and varies by jurisdiction. Your custody solution must adhere to local regulations, particularly regarding anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) laws. Your tech provider should enable you to comply with local regulations and adhere to data protection laws. For example, in the United States, custodial service providers might need to register as a Money Services Business (MSB) and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Certifications and audits, such as SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 compliance, are vital indicators of a custody provider\u2019s commitment to regulatory compliance and operational integrity. Failure to adhere to regulations can result in severe consequences. Just look at the recent case of Galois Capital. Galois settled the lawsuit from the SEC for $225,000 without admitting wrongdoing, but the damage was done. Scalability and performance are critical when evaluating a custody solution. It must handle large transaction volumes while maintaining speed and security. Beyond safeguarding assets, the custody platform needs to support high transaction throughput, real-time data processing and streamlined workflows to meet your day-to-day operational demands. A robust custody solution should integrate effortlessly with your institution\u2019s existing operational, financial and compliance systems. Look for providers that offer APIs or connectors to facilitate smooth data exchange and minimize disruptions. Additionally, operational resilience\u2014such as real-time monitoring, audit logs and automated reconciliation features\u2014ensures that your custody infrastructure supports not only secure storage but also efficient, ongoing management of digital assets. A robust custody solution is secure, but it also empowers institutions with customizable control over workflows and policies. Our company's Policy Engine, for example, enables granular control over transaction approvals, user permissions, and access settings\u2014allowing administrators to tailor workflows to fit specific operational needs and compliance requirements. This flexibility ensures that institutions can enforce security standards without compromising on usability. Look for a platform that integrates seamlessly with existing core banking systems, enabling smooth interaction between digital assets and traditional finance. Whether users are managing transfers, staking or tokenization, the platform should offer customizable dashboards, enabling fast, intuitive access across desktop and mobile. The result is a custody solution built for real-world operations, providing control, ease and agility without a steep learning curve. Initial low prices for custody solutions can be misleading, often concealing hidden fees or additional charges that emerge as usage scales. When evaluating costs, it's crucial to look beyond upfront pricing and consider long-term implications, such as whether transaction fees or maintenance costs will rise as your assets grow. A true cost vs. value analysis means considering the full financial impact of your custody solution over time. While a higher-quality solution may have a larger initial cost, it\u2019s likely to offer stability, scalability and fewer unexpected expenses. Better to invest in a secure, predictable solution with transparent pricing\u2014protecting you from the risk of costly incidents like hacks or service outages. Remember, you can\u2019t afford to be the victim of a hack even once. In digital asset custody, cheap won\u2019t always make you cheerful. Evaluating your custody solution provider involves a thorough examination of several critical factors to ensure the safety and accessibility of your digital assets. First, assess the security measures in place, including the use of encryption standards and incident response plans. Second, consider the regulatory compliance of the provider, ensuring adherence to local and international laws and the presence of necessary certifications and audits. Third, evaluate the technological infrastructure, focusing on scalability, performance and integration capabilities. Fourth, ensure maximum flexibility and control over your users and their privileges. Finally, consider the cost and fee structures, performing a cost vs. value analysis to understand the trade-offs between different solutions. Ultimately, the decision comes down to your individual needs and preferences. It's important to thoroughly understand and evaluate each aspect of the custody solutions available. The integrity of all financial solutions is based on trust, and custody is the root of trust when it comes to your customers\u2019 digital assets.

    "full_text": "As bitcoin continues to reshape society, it brings with it the possibility of a world united by a ... [+] common language of value and trade. Bitcoin is a revolutionary digital currency that operates without banks or central authorities. Created as a decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems, it enables peer-to-peer transactions on a global scale. This guide will explain what bitcoin is, how it works and why it matters, including its unique technology, uses, advantages and challenges. By the end, you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of bitcoin's role in the financial world and its future potential. Bitcoin was created in 2008 by an anonymous individual or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It launched in 2009 with the aim of providing a decentralized, borderless digital currency that operates outside the control of banks and governments. Nakamoto stated that his work was motivated by distrust in centralized financial systems as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis. Bitcoin matters because it solved a key problem in computer science that led to the invention of digital scarcity. The Bitcoin Network has been continuously operating since its inception, proving that a decentralized monetary network can enable secure, transparent financial transactions without intermediaries. Over time, bitcoin has grown from a niche experiment to a globally recognized asset, offering new possibilities for digital payments, investment and financial freedom. Bitcoin is a form of hard money that enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks or governments. It operates on a public database called a blockchain that records all transactions transparently and securely. This innovation eliminates the need for trust in third parties, making bitcoin the first digital bearer asset. The network is extremely robust and predictable, making it well suited for both global digital payments and long-term investment. Bitcoin possesses strong monetary properties that set it apart as a financial asset. It is durable, existing digitally without the possibility of physical decay; portable, enabling easy transfer across long distances; and divisible, allowing transactions at the nano scale. It is also verifiable, with every transaction able to be cryptographically validated, and scarce, capped at a fixed supply of 21 million coins. What makes bitcoin distinct from other cryptocurrencies is that it is decentralized, free from centralized control, and censorship resistant, meaning that transactions cannot be blocked or reversed. Additionally, it carries no counterparty risk \u2014 individual owners control the asset directly, rather than banks or financial companies. Bitcoin also benefits from growing regulatory clarity, making it increasingly trusted by institutions, investors, and even sovereign nations. At the heart of bitcoin\u2019s success is its innovative protocol, which enables secure, transparent and trustless transactions. This section explores how bitcoin transactions work, the concept of a blockchain, and why consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work are central to bitcoin's integrity. Bitcoin transactions are recorded in its blockchain \u2014 a public, distributed ledger that contains every bitcoin transaction ever made. When a person initiates a transaction, it is signed with a secure digital signature and broadcast as a message to the network. Miners listen for these messages and do computational work to bundle these messages into blocks with a size of about one megabyte. When a miner successfully constructs a block, it is broadcast back out to the network where bitcoin nodes verify that it is valid. If it is, the block is added to the blockchain. Once added, blocks become part of an immutable ledger shared across the entire planet. Participation in this network is completely voluntary and open, making bitcoin a truly peer-to-peer system. To maintain a single, universal version of the blockchain, bitcoin uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). PoW requires miners to expend real-world energy to order transactions into valid blocks. This process ensures that everyone can agree on the correct the chronological order of transactions. The expenditure of energy ties the Bitcoin Network to the physical world. Since mining consumes real-world energy, it comes at the opportunity cost of expending that energy (and the money needed to pay for it) on other things. In contrast, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum use Proof of Stake (PoS), where token holders \u201cstake\u201d their assets to validate transactions. This system mirrors traditional finance, granting more power and influence to the wealthiest participants. Proof of Work (PoW), however, ensures that bitcoin remains resistant to control by wealth alone, making it far more resilient against centralization and malicious actors. A transaction begins when a user creates and signs it with their private key, ensuring security and authenticity. The transaction is broadcast to the network, where miners validate it and add it to a block. Once included in the blockchain, the transaction is final, immutable and visible to all participants. This process ensures trustless verification, censorship resistance and global accessibility, distinguishing bitcoin from traditional payment systems. Bitcoin mining is the process through which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation and transactions are ordered on the ledger. Miners play a crucial role by organizing transactions into blocks and ensuring the security and integrity of the Bitcoin Network through unforgeable costliness. Bitcoin mining is the process that takes free-floating bitcoin messages being broadcast on the internet and structures them into stable, immutable chunks of data called \u201cblocks.\u201d Bitcoin mining involves miners collecting unconfirmed transactions from the network and assembling them into a candidate block. They then expend significant computational resources to structure these transactions into valid blocks. When a miner finds a valid block, we can be extremely confident that the only way they could have done so would have been to expend energy. This is the unforgeable costliness that secures the network and ties the digital nature of bitcoin to physical reality. It is a common misconception that miners validate transactions. In fact, they do not \u2013 instead, they order transactions according to the bitcoin protocol rules. Independent nodes validate blocks that are found by miners, ensuring that miners are complying with the protocol. When a node sees a new block, it checks whether it is valid. If it is, it is added to the blockchain. This mechanism ensures that altering the blockchain requires immense computational effort, making attacks economically infeasible. By tying security to real-world energy expenditure, bitcoin maintains resilience against centralization and malicious actors, differentiating it from other financial and cryptocurrency networks that rely on trust or wealth concentration to operate. The supply of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, a feature that is hard-coded into the bitcoin protocol. This scarcity is designed to ensure bitcoin is a deflationary asset, giving it some similarities to scarce commodities like gold. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed at will, bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply ensures that its holders cannot be diluted by individuals or cabals issuing more monetary units. Every 210,000 blocks, which is the number of blocks mined in about four years, the number of bitcoins that miners receive for solving blocks is cut in half. This is called a \u201chalving,\u201d and it reduces the number of new coins entering circulation. When the Bitcoin Network started, the block reward was 50 bitcoins. Today it is a mere 3.125 bitcoins (but those bitcoins are worth a lot more). Halving events slow the rate of bitcoin\u2019s supply growth and create predictable scarcity. This process will continue until the last bitcoin is mined, estimated to occur circa 2140. Bitcoin\u2019s role in the global economy is evolving as it is adopted by more people every day. As of this writing, it is commonly recognized as a digital currency, a store of value, and a solution for cross-border transactions. Bitcoin\u2019s properties make it uniquely suited for these uses in ways that traditional financial systems cannot match. As a digital currency, bitcoin enables direct, peer-to-peer payments without reliance on banks or other intermediaries. While its adoption as a medium of exchange remains limited, technologies like the Lightning Network are making payments faster and more cost-effective. These developments position bitcoin for broader use in day-to-day commerce, particularly in enabling payments that are global, final and free from geographical restrictions. Bitcoin\u2019s most established role is as a store of value, allowing individuals to preserve wealth over time. Despite price volatility, bitcoin\u2019s rising long-term value and fixed supply of 21 million coins make it a deflationary asset. In economies with unstable currencies, bitcoin provides a safeguard against inflation, currency debasement or asset confiscation \u2014 offering financial security unavailable through traditional fiat systems. As confidence in the dollar system erodes, bitcoin is viewed as a safe haven even in developed economies. Bitcoin\u2019s borderless infrastructure is transforming international payments by eliminating inefficiencies like currency conversions and high fees. Traditional cross-border transfers are often slow and expensive, but bitcoin provides near-instant, low-cost, and final settlement between any two parties on the planet. This capability enhances international trade and commerce, offering businesses and individuals a streamlined alternative to conventional financial systems. Bitcoin offers significant advantages over traditional financial systems, providing security and transparency, lower transaction fees and financial freedom. These attributes have made bitcoin a transformative force in both developed and developing economies, empowering individuals to take control of their wealth and participate in a truly unfettered market for goods and services. Bitcoin\u2019s security is underpinned by its method of achieving consensus, called Proof of Work. The transparency of the bitcoin ledger and the consensus that it represents ensures that anyone can verify transactions without relying on a central authority. Perhaps even more impressively, bitcoin\u2019s protocol aligns incentives to deter attacks. Instead of attempting to compromise the network, which would be extremely energy intensive with little upside, bad actors are financially better off participating honestly by mining bitcoin or accumulating it within the system. This design makes bitcoin the most secure financial system ever created and highly resistant to censorship and unilateral control. Moving fiat money on traditional financial rails, particularly for international transactions, is costly. Wire transfers and international payments often involve steep fees and delays, while ACH reversals cost the U.S. economy billions annually. Bitcoin addresses these inefficiencies with significantly lower transaction fees and reliable final settlement. To move a billion dollars worth of bitcoin costs only a few dollars. For smaller payments, the Lightning Network can be used, which is a newer technology that can move real, physical bitcoin while incurring extremely low fees. Bitcoin embodies values of individual liberty, private property and resistance to coercion. It empowers people to save and secure their wealth without dependence on governments or financial institutions, which are often subject to mismanagement and corruption. Bitcoiners view it as a superior form of money designed for saving and spending, not speculating. When you adopt bitcoin, you are joining a global community committed to creating a future where people have full control over their financial lives, free from external interference. This financial empowerment fosters economic growth and personal sovereignty, making bitcoin a tool for advancing liberty. While bitcoin offers transformative potential, it faces challenges that continue to draw criticism, including volatility in price, regulatory concerns and the environmental impact of mining. These issues highlight areas where bitcoin is evolving and must address criticisms. Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility is a natural feature of a new asset in its discovery phase. Its price has experienced dramatic swings, driven by adoption cycles and market sentiment. However, history shows that bitcoin consistently recovers from crashes, and as adoption grows, its volatility decreases. Critics often overlook the inherent instability of fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, which has lost 90% of its purchasing power in the past 50 years due to inflation. Over time, bitcoin\u2019s finite supply and increased liquidity are expected to stabilize its price, offering an alternative to inflationary fiat systems. Governments have expressed concern about bitcoin\u2019s ability to operate without oversight or control. Countries like China and India have attempted bans, but bitcoin\u2019s protocol, as open-source software, has made such bans impossible to enforce. Meanwhile, countries such as El Salvador have embraced bitcoin as legal tender, and U.S. regulators classify it as a commodity, signaling broader acceptance. In the U.S., other cryptocurrencies that lack bitcoin\u2019s decentralized structure enjoy less regulatory clarity. Crypto tokens often face stricter scrutiny as they have more in common with traditional securities than commodity money like gold and bitcoin. Bitcoin mining\u2019s energy consumption has sparked debates about its environmental impact. However, miners are incentivized to seek the most cost-efficient energy sources, often turning to renewables or utilizing stranded energy that would otherwise go to waste. In fact, data shows that industrial-scale bitcoin mining actually promotes environmental responsibility. Unlike fiat currencies, bitcoin\u2019s energy use is measurable and transparent, whereas fiat systems impose hidden costs in the form of enormous bureaucratic structures needed to manage banking and compliance. The maintenance of the dollar\u2019s status as the mandated trading currency for oil is one of the key drivers of military spending in the United States, costing trillions and taking a significant toll on the environment. Inflationary fiat systems also drive short-term thinking, which leads to frivolous consumption and environmental exploitation. Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory is one of steady growth and increasing relevance. As a trustless, scarce and borderless monetary system, bitcoin is reshaping the very concept of what money can be. Its future hinges on its ability to achieve widespread adoption by leveraging technological advancements and navigating competition from other cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This section explores the transformative potential of bitcoin, highlighting the factors that position it as a cornerstone of a more inclusive and resilient financial system. Bitcoin adoption has been steadily increasing, driven by growing distrust in fiat currencies and centralized financial systems. The unprecedented expansion of the money supply, particularly in the wake of recent economic crises, has heightened demand for alternatives to government-issued currencies. This adoption is fueled by its utility as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, appealing to both wealthy investors and unbanked populations in developing economies. Generational shifts further support mass adoption. Younger generations, more comfortable with digital technologies and skeptical of traditional banking, are inheriting trillions of dollars in wealth. This demographic shift, combined with increasing global internet access, is lowering barriers to bitcoin usage. It is estimated that 560 million people already own bitcoin. Its decentralized, global network makes the prospect of bitcoin disappearing nearly impossible. Technological innovations are making bitcoin more accessible, private and versatile. Layer 2 technologies, like the Lightning Network, enable faster and cheaper payments, enhancing bitcoin\u2019s usefulness as a medium of exchange. Privacy improvements like Silent Payments are set to enhance bitcoin\u2019s role as a tool for advancing liberty by allowing people to accept on-chain bitcoin payments while remaining anonymous. Meanwhile, slick new hardware devices make self-custody through cold storage more accessible, giving users control over their wealth. Discreet log contracts (DLCs) are an exciting area of financial innovation, allowing for the creation of new lending protocols and option trading protocols with dramatically lower counterparty risk. These software services allow bitcoin holders to access liquidity without selling their assets or relinquishing custody, mimicking traditional banking functions with significantly increased individual autonomy. Bitcoin\u2019s position as the universally recognized digital money faces occasional challenges from other cryptocurrencies claiming faster transactions, lower costs or enhanced features. Yet, these tradeoffs come at the expense of something fundamental: the ability to serve as money. Across all economies, trading activity consolidates around the \u201chardest\u201d form of money \u2014 the medium best suited to store and transfer value over time. Bitcoin stands apart from other crypto projects, not just for its fixed supply and absence of counterparty risk, but for its status as the hardest form of money ever invented or discovered. The Bitcoin Network\u2019s security budget, as defined by its hash rate and, ultimately, the cost of energy being used to protect the network, is orders of magnitude higher than any competing cryptocurrency. This serves as physical and mathematical proof of bitcoin\u2019s dominance as a monetary standard. Bitcoin is a technological breakthrough on par with the greatest inventions of the modern age, and just like those inventions, it will transform society. By providing a foundation of sound, incorruptible digital money, bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize how humans coordinate, invest, and innovate. Its fixed supply, transparency, and global accessibility create a framework for unprecedented economic efficiency and long-term planning. Periods of great progress in history have been fueled by sound money. Bitcoin, as the hardest money ever created, is poised to usher in a renaissance for the digital age. From fostering scientific discovery to underwriting ambitious projects, bitcoin empowers humanity to tackle challenges and pursue goals that span generations. On a global scale, bitcoin\u2019s resistance to manipulation and coercion is already leading to greater accountability among governments. By encumbering governments\u2019 ability to use fiat debasement to fund war and repression, bitcoin is laying the groundwork for an era of tolerance, peace, and prosperity. As a universal language of value, it can connect people and foster understanding across locations and cultures. Adopting bitcoin is an act of investment in a future where independence, inclusion, and freedom are prioritized. As bitcoin continues to reshape society, it brings with it the possibility of a world united by a common language of value and trade. Bitcoin was created in 2008 by an anonymous individual or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Their true identity remains unknown, but the open-source protocol they developed is maintained and improved by a global community of software developers. Bitcoin is legal in many countries, including the United States, where it is classified as a commodity. Some nations, like El Salvador, have even adopted it as legal tender. However, regulations vary, and certain countries have imposed restrictions or bans on its use. Unlike traditional money, bitcoin operates without central authorities, relying on a decentralized network to verify and record transactions. It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflation, and can be transferred globally without intermediaries, enabling low-cost payments with final settlement every 10 minutes. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is highly secure, leveraging cryptography and decentralized consensus to prevent hacking or corruption. While the network itself has never been compromised, individual accounts or wallets can be vulnerable if private keys are not stored securely. Using cold storage and strong security practices can mitigate these risks.  One Community.

    "full_text": "One of the most significant factors for the crypto industry lies not in market dynamics, but in the political arena. Trump\u2019s pro-crypto rhetoric certainly grabbed headlines, but the real catalyst for banks and other financial intermediaries is likely a Republican sweep in Congress, given that most of his pledges would require legislative approval. With strong Republican backing and bipartisan support also showing momentum, crypto-friendly legalisation would be far more likely to pass. Two developments are central to this shift: dismantling the SEC\u2019s SAB 121 (which has kept much of the financial sector sidelined) and the Bitcoin Act 2024 (which proposes a national bitcoin stockpile). You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Revocation of SAB 121 SAB 121 is a contentious accounting bulletin that has created a compliance burden, discouraging banks from offering services like crypto custody \u2014 despite the rising demand from customers (and likely from the banks themselves). Dismantling SAB 121 would remove a major chokehold on banks, allowing them to offer crypto custody services and further diversify their product offerings into staking and other yield-bearing products. This mirrors what we have seen in the ETF market, where institutional involvement fundamentally changes market dynamics. It would also allow banks to defend their assets under management, retain clients, and increase their share of wallet among existing clients interested in crypto, while attracting a younger generation of crypto-native customers. This is likely the route towards mainstream adoption as banks could offer retail customers simplified or \u201call-in-one\u201d financial services. Bitcoin Act 2024 Trump also promised to push the Bitcoin Act 2024, which aims to establish a strategic bitcoin stockpile as part of U.S. Treasury reserves. Similar initiatives are already underway in Brazil, and U.S. states like Pennsylvania have already introduced their own bitcoin reserve bill. If adopted, bitcoin\u2019s safe haven status would be fully legitimised, and the market implications could be substantial by fundamentally changing how central banks and corporate treasurers approach their allocation strategies. We have already seen how the involvement of TradFi heavyweights and institutional ETF flows can impact the market, and central bank purchases could amplify these effects dramatically. Political figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis even suggest the Federal Reserve should reallocate some of its gold reserves to bitcoin, opening up the possibility of bitcoin narrowing its gap with gold\u2019s $17.7 trillion market cap \u2014 more than 9x bitcoin\u2019s $1.9 trillion. Additional pledges Trump\u2019s broader agenda also targets the shutting down of banking restrictions tied to Operation Choke Point 2.0, a measure alleged to have debanked over 70 crypto firms, according to a16z\u2019s Marc Andreessen. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s opposition to a Fed-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC) aligns with Republican efforts to protect privacy through measures like the CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, which would ban the Fed from using a CBDC without congressional approvals. Whether the U.S. transitions from a regulatory laggard to a legislative leader remains to be seen. But the opportunity is clear: the U.S. is the world\u2019s largest financial market with the potential to bring substantial change and traction to the crypto economy.

    "full_text": "Vall Herard is the CEO of Saifr, offering powerful safeguards against compliance risks.   If you\u2019ve used generative AI\u2014and I\u2019m willing to bet you have\u2014then you\u2019re probably familiar with the importance of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive amounts of historical data; this access to past content enables the model to \u201ccreate\u201d new content. But LLMs can't generate novel ideas. These models simply analyze existing data from their training set, identify common word sequences and predict the next word or phrase based on historical patterns. This process is helpful for brainstorming or identifying oversight in your thinking but not for executing complex requests. However, with the imminent popularization of agentic AI, this status quo is expected to change dramatically. AI is set to become incredibly insightful and adept at accomplishing more complicated and nuanced tasks. And with these emerging capabilities, business leaders\u2014especially those in highly regulated sectors\u2014will need to prepare for a significant increase in AI oversight. Let\u2019s review what leaders should know about AI\u2019s evolution in 2025 and beyond. Although agentic AI starts with LLMs, it differs substantially from current AI offerings. We can break its most significant improvements down into three categories: 1. Self-Evaluation: Fascinatingly enough, current LLMs will acknowledge their propensity for hallucinations. Still, they can't internalize the feedback that these fabricated statistics and data points are actively harmful and should be avoided at all costs. That will be less the case for agentic AI. As part of the model\u2019s training, agents can execute a task multiple times and receive a grade for their outputs each time. They\u2019ll learn which output is most optimal and use that judgment to improve down the line. 2. Tool Integration: LLMs rely on data from their training set to generate responses to your queries. But what about highly contextual data like up-to-date weather information or your daughter\u2019s graduation date? Agentic AI will soon be able to tap into this information because of increased interoperability with relevant tools. These could include calculators, weather apps, airline booking systems or even other AI models. 3. Memory Systems: Of course, very few of these improvements would make a difference without memory. Agentic AI can remember and learn from its incorrect answers, improving over time. Current LLMs rely heavily on existing data, which poses a problem. According to Epoch AI, we\u2019ll run out of new textual data by 2028. So, LLMs will stagnate after that date if they continue to learn solely based on historical data. By taking a more targeted approach to AI development, agentic AI can help mitigate the consequences of diminishing data availability. Until now, the axiom \u201cthe bigger, the better\u201d has prevailed, so we\u2019ve trained LLMs with as much data as possible. However, we\u2019re learning that quality is more important than quantity. We can conceptualize this further using the example of coding. We know there are millions of ways to code a webpage. However, AI doesn\u2019t need to be trained on suboptimal examples. It just needs to learn how to code excellently using only robust examples. By focusing on training AI to do something perfectly\u2014rather than how not to do something\u2014we can use less data while elevating the quality of AI\u2019s outputs. Additionally, when we rely on less data to train AI, we create models that are less expensive to run and maintain. This can improve the cost-benefit analysis of adopting AI, clarifying its impact on your bottom line. Smaller, more specialized models won\u2019t be the only option in 2025. LLMs will continue to be popular in certain industries due to their broad, generalized intelligence. However, LLMs are vulnerable to regulatory challenges, making it essential for companies relying on them to implement robust safety layers to help ensure compliance and mitigate risks. The EU AI Act, which came into effect in early 2024, introduces stringent requirements for AI systems\u2014many of which prove a challenge for current LLMs. This regulatory gap extends to industry-specific rules such as SEC Rule 482, FINRA Rule 2210 and HIPAA. To bridge these gaps, leaders can use a safety layer or middleware to integrate with existing AI models, vetting outputs to help ensure they comply with relevant regulations. Doing so will be crucial for enterprises in highly regulated sectors like finance and healthcare. Agentic AI can also prove crucial in this area. Through its capacity for self-evaluation, integration and memory, agentic AI unlocks chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT enables agentic AI systems to excel at solving complex, multistep problems, like math problems, symbolic riddles and common-sense reasoning. When equipped with regulation-focused middleware, CoT also allows agentic AI to weigh its output against important laws. For example, agentic AI could reasonably perform the following prompt in just minutes: \u201cWrite a five-page article about the best credit card options on the market. Please make the content compliant with SEC rule 482, FINRA rule 2210 and Regulation Best Interest. Based on common spending portfolios, show returns for one, three and five years. Compare and contrast with less attractive credit card options.\u201d McKinsey researchers estimate that AI will add $13 trillion to global economic output by 2030. However, we can only realize this potential if we address current limitations around LLMs\u2019 reliability, safety and compliance. Thus, agentic AI isn't only a prudent development\u2014it\u2019s a necessary one. Organizations that understand and embrace these advances\u2014while focusing on safety and compliance\u2014will be ready to leverage the full extent of AI-based reasoning by 2026.

    "full_text": "When exploring investment opportunities abroad, business leaders must carefully evaluate the stability of a country's market to mitigate risks and maximize returns. For example, political stability is a critical factor, as unrest or unpredictable policies can disrupt operations and profitability. Economic indicators such as inflation rates and currency stability can also provide insights into the market's financial health. Below, Forbes Finance Council members share key factors to consider when assessing the stability of a foreign market. Follow their advice as you plan your path toward a worthwhile investment. Business leaders who aim to utilize foreign investments shall ensure the market of interest offers sufficient and easy-to-navigate banking infrastructures, favorable foreign taxation policies, attractive local government policies with minimal control for such investments and a reasonable timeline for the investment to come to fruition, considering all local adversaries. - Reza Ghazi, GreenFlow Financial Business leaders should consider economic indicators, regulatory frameworks, political stability, infrastructure and social factors. For social housing investment, analyzing supportive government policies, availability of long-term leases with providers and economic resilience is key. Reviewing incentives, local partnerships and social demand\u2014 including large affordable housing waitlists\u2014can secure investments. - Frank Cartwright, CKS Group Business leaders should review fraud and corruption indices like the World Bank Corruption Index, OECD Integrity Outlook, Transparency International Corruption Perception Index and the Financial Crime Index. Markets with high scores on these measures carry substantial financial and legal risks but also present potential for strategic gains when risks are carefully managed. - Jonny Frank, StoneTurn There are a lot of considerations to take into account while examining a foreign market. Evaluate the workforce's skill level, the stability of the legislation and if the environment and technology can help you achieve your objectives. Assess regional politics, supply chain dependability, cultural fit and future competitors. - Corey Digi, Lexington Capital Holdings When assessing a foreign market\u2019s stability, business leaders should look beyond the basics. Consider the market\u2019s resilience to economic shifts, the reliability of local partnerships and adaptability to regulatory changes. Assessing these alongside long-term growth potential and cultural alignment ensures a well-rounded investment decision. - Frankie DiAntonio, Lexington Capital Holdings Forbes Finance Council is an invitation-only organization for executives in successful accounting, financial planning and wealth management firms. Do I qualify? When evaluating a foreign market for investment, I consider economic stability, currency fluctuations, political environment and local regulations, as these affect risk and costs. Also, measure demand for your product, cultural fit and infrastructure quality to ensure ease of doing business and long-term viability in that foreign market. - Jared Weitz, United Capital Source Inc. Business leaders seek stability and predictability in foreign investment. High inflation, a history of limited economic growth and the lack of stable currency are important signals of problems. Examining interest rates, levels of unemployment, predictable public policy and conditions for volatility in financial growth can all provide clues for potentially stable investments in foreign markets. - Jeffrey Bartel, Hamptons Group, LLC Business leaders should evaluate a foreign market\u2019s economic stability, regulatory environment and political climate. Key factors include currency risk, local demand trends and ease of repatriating profits. Analyzing competitive landscape and cultural compatibility also helps in anticipating operational challenges. - Sumeet Grover, Alliant Foreign investing requires copious due diligence. All the risk factors present in domestic investing likely exist, plus many others, including the geopolitical landscape, regulatory environment, trade relations, currency exchange rates and overall competitiveness to similar domestic opportunities. International asset managers likely focus on a narrow region for these reasons. - Ryan Loynd, BrightGuide Financial Evaluate the accessibility of local financing and banking stability. A mature financial system can facilitate smoother transactions and offer resources for potential expansion. - Shivali Kukreja, NIB NZ Business leaders must consider political, financial and legal issues to assess the stability of foreign markets. Support across the political spectrum to encourage private business growth is a positive sign and should be accompanied by a predictable tax regime. A secure banking system and an independent and swift judicial system should give business leaders further confidence in their investments. - Abhishek Nanda, Revalize The stability of the government is a major concern but digging deeper can also reveal political unrest or disagreements with the central bank. The country\u2019s attitude towards foreign investment and banking must be considered. Any large investment\u2014especially ones requiring infrastructure\u2014should include a local partner who knows the territory, speaks the language and helps share the risk. - David T. Nudelman, Scandinavian Capital Markets Start by studying the country\u2019s history. Frequent wars or economic disruptions over decades signal instability. Next, evaluate if the foreign market operates under the \"rule of law\"\u2014long-term stability is unlikely under the \"rule of men.\" Finally, assess downside protections. Are there recourse options, political insurance or forces in the target market to prevent further deterioration? - Lechi (Richard) Zhang, Stonelake Capital There are numerous factors to consider, and some of the most important include: economic and political stability, market demand for innovative solutions like AI, talent and infrastructure, regulatory environment and compliance risks, cost-benefit analysis and cultural and operational fit. - Zehra Soysal, Metaphysic.ai When evaluating a foreign market, business leaders should look at the overall economic health, how stable the government is and whether local laws protect foreign investors. It\u2019s also critical to consider currency stability, demand for their products and the country\u2019s infrastructure. These factors help paint a clearer picture of whether the market is a safe and smart place to grow their business. - Geanette Rodriguez-Ojeda, G.R.O. Accounting and Tax When you're thinking about investing in a foreign market, first off, look at the political stability. You don\u2019t want sudden changes. Then, check the economy growth potential, inflation trends and how stable the currency is to assess the infrastructure. Can you rely on these? The legal environment is super important, too. - Asli Erem, The Marmara Hotels Understanding cultural nuances is essential. Businesses must adapt their models to local traditions, values and norms. Marketing strategies need tailoring to ensure brand messaging resonates, avoiding misinterpretation. This requires modifications to language, tone, symbols and imagery to align with expectations. Culturally aligned approaches foster trust, brand acceptance and long-term success. - Anushree Jain, Titan For business owners looking to make a foreign investment, they must understand the regulatory, political and tax environment, in addition to the cultural norms of the country\u2019s consumers and the ability to repatriate capital from that country. - Royce Ramey, Versant Capital Management When considering foreign market investment, it\u2019s important to look to strategic partners to take on specialized programs. This approach allows leaders to focus on their core business. Leveraging partnerships to provide automation with streamlined payments and invoicing systems, for example, facilitates preferred transaction methods that are in line with tax compliance and cultural nuances. - Brandon Spear, TreviPay I would rate the following four factors as most critical for making offshore investments. Political stability is important because frequent changes in leadership or policies can affect investment security. Macroeconomic indicators\u2014like growth rates, inflation and currency stability\u2014are also important. Also, consider the legal framework to protect investors' interests. Lastly, consider the available talent pool and cost of local talent. - Amit Jain, Dhruva Advisors USA Inc.

    "full_text": "Richard Polgar, CFO of CFG Merchant Solutions & CapFlow Funding Group.   Establishing and nurturing strong relationships with senior lenders is pivotal for maintaining a company\u2019s financial strength in a challenging market environment while also sustaining a consistent growth trajectory. Drawing from extensive experience in commercial lending and corporate finance, I\u2019ll share advanced strategic approaches to help you form a robust alliance with senior lenders. Transparent communication forms the bedrock of any partnership, but a nuanced approach can enhance it further. This involves going beyond relaying information to proactively address potential questions and concerns. For example, one of our borrowers faced a sudden liquidity issue because of unexpected delays in receivables. Instead of waiting until it became a crisis, they reached out early to discuss the situation. Our team worked closely with them to adjust payment terms and provided additional resources to help manage cash flow. This open dialogue resolved the immediate issue while also deepening our relationship with the borrower. This kind of foresight resonates profoundly with senior lenders, demonstrating a proactive and thoughtful approach. Understanding your business goes beyond industry-specific knowledge. You need a thorough grasp of macroeconomic trends, geopolitical influences and regulatory landscapes. By positioning yourself as a keen observer of the broader financial ecosystem, you can not only predict potential impacts on your company but also showcase a depth of strategic thinking that garners trust and aligns with senior lenders\u2019 interests. To cultivate relationships with senior lenders, you need to have a strong foundation made up of an experienced team. Amid a challenging market environment, your team\u2019s business knowledge and technical proficiency in generating precise data and insightful analyses serve as a linchpin. This is particularly important when addressing ad hoc senior lender data requests, assuring them that their loan exposure with your company is backed by ample collateral. Your financial analysts, finance managers and executive team play a key role in establishing an accurate flow of information. This team should go beyond routine assessments; they should anticipate potential issues and leverage advanced tools to identify risks. Your team\u2019s expertise signifies a commitment to making well-informed decisions that safeguard senior lenders\u2019 interests and ensure enduring financial partnerships. While risk management and having the right team in place are fundamental, integrating advanced analytics and modeling techniques could provide deeper insights. Employing predictive analytics and stress testing methodologies allows you to anticipate potential risks with a higher degree of accuracy, enabling more precise risk mitigation strategies. From my experience, a thorough risk assessment should include an in-depth review of key areas such as cash flow projections, client payment behavior, market trends and operational efficiencies. Leaders should also assess external factors such as regulatory changes and shifts in customer demand that may impact the business\u2019s financial stability. One commonly overlooked risk is depending on a few large clients. If one of them experiences financial strain, that could significantly affect revenue. Additionally, failing to account for cyber threats is another often-missed risk. Conducting comprehensive risk assessments that encompass both internal operations and external threats ensures you stay ahead of potential challenges. This proactive approach safeguards the collateral of senior lenders and demonstrates your commitment to preserving the partnership\u2019s financial health. Reliability extends beyond timeliness; it includes technological proficiency. Implementing advanced financial systems and analytics platforms not only streamlines reporting, it also enhances the depth and accuracy of insights. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning can further increase the precision of your analyses. This technological prowess showcases a commitment to efficiency and accuracy, which can instill confidence in the senior lender. In a rapidly evolving financial industry, agile financial governance is incredibly important. This involves integrating scenario planning and dynamic forecasting techniques. Dynamic forecasting refers to the process of continuously updating financial models based on real-time data and evolving market conditions. Rather than relying on static, long-term forecasts, it enables more responsive decision making. For instance, regularly adjusting cash flow projections or financial performance expectations as new information becomes available can help preemptively address financial challenges. One technique that has proven particularly beneficial to the borrower-lender relationship is rolling forecasts, which are updated monthly or quarterly to reflect the latest data and trends. This allows borrowers to stay ahead of potential issues, such as declining revenues or shifts in market demand, and helps lenders to feel confident that borrowers are managing risks proactively. Fostering a culture of adaptability within your organization ensures that all stakeholders, including senior lenders, are comfortable with your management team\u2019s ability to respond effectively to unforeseen challenges. This dynamic approach positions the partnership for sustained success in even the most unpredictable financial environments. In summary, to maintain a successful partnership, you need to align your strategies with the interests of senior lenders. By understanding and addressing their priorities, such as risk mitigation, return on investment and regulatory compliance, you can create a collaborative environment that benefits all parties involved. This alignment enhances trust while promoting stability and long-term growth.

    "full_text": "Monica O'Reilly is the vice chairman and the U.S. financial services leader of Deloitte.   Customer needs and expectations have evolved dramatically in recent years\u2014and they will continue to evolve in the coming decade. Factors including new technologies, economic pressures and the growing purchasing power of digital-native generations are shaping what customers want from their financial institutions. Customers expect fast, seamless and personalized experiences from their banks. But while digital channels powered by AI are increasingly preferred by most for routine transactions, attended channels that can provide the human touch are still important for moments that matter. Indeed, Deloitte research found that about as many millennials prefer the branch for financial advice as those who prefer digital channels. But that, too, may change with rapid advances in the capabilities of generative AI (GenAI). Take investment advice, for example: Deloitte has predicted that 78% of investors will interact with GenAI-enabled investment advice applications by 2028. As a result, traditional financial services industry (FSI) business models must advance to meet evolving customer needs and preferences. A platform-based business model, in which companies from within and across industries form partnerships to offer customers integrated journeys and diverse products and services in a single location, is one approach that has real potential. Customers are already comfortable using subscription services and digital ecosystems in other areas of their lives\u2014as demonstrated by the success of streaming services offered by technology firms. But is the financial services industry ready to make the leap? Traditional financial institutions have so far been slow to make significant investments in ecosystems. Fintech and big tech companies, on the other hand, are actively developing ecosystem capabilities. As a result, financial institutions can expect growing competition from such innovators. This pressure to evolve quickly comes while the industry is facing significant headwinds. The potential for \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest rates and dampened consumer spending are impacting revenue growth in many sectors squeezing profitability, and regulatory scrutiny is intensifying. Financial institutions must navigate these challenges while also investing in new growth opportunities and meeting customer demands. A successful financial services ecosystem would provide one-stop shopping for various products and services through strategic partnerships and \"co-opetition.\" For example, if a customer qualifies for a home loan, the platform could automatically connect them with insurance providers in an integrated, frictionless experience. This approach has already been demonstrated in automobile sales, where the insurance is \u201cembedded\u201d into the purchase. The ecosystem could also leverage AI and advanced data analytics to go beyond the home purchase by providing customers with predictive insights and tailored recommendations across their retirement planning and investment portfolios. A viable ecosystem would need to maintain compliance with rigorous regulatory standards for third-party risk management and approval processes for participating providers to ensure consumer protection. Even so, this model could create mutually beneficial opportunities for both well-established financial institutions and their non-FSI partners, including fintech startups, large tech firms and consumer businesses. Tiered subscription frameworks could provide customers with different levels of access to advisory services, investment insights and financial planning tools. For customers, an ecosystem model offers the convenience of connectivity. They can manage every element of their financial life from one dashboard, instead of managing multiple products on multiple websites. If they trusted that the platform was designed with their best interests in mind, they could rely on it to meet all of their financial needs. For financial institutions, an ecosystem model presents opportunities to create new revenue streams and products. By building partnerships and analyzing how customers interact across different financial services, they can develop targeted products and services that better meet their customers' needs. However, regulatory hurdles could slow progress. For example, the CFPB\u2019s recently released final rule on consumer data rights protection will place new demands on financial institutions and others to make sure there\u2019s an operationally sound approach to protect consumers and maintain their trust in using these models. There's also a risk of market concentration, with only a few dominant platforms emerging\u2014similar to what has happened in the tech sector\u2014and raising antitrust concerns. Maintaining the status quo is not a realistic strategy for the financial services industry. The writing is on the wall: Traditional business models will either plateau or decline. Institutions need to be open to change and proactively explore new ways of meeting and anticipating the needs of younger generations. It's time to ask some important questions: \u2022 Is the industry ready to embrace an ecosystem model? \u2022 What requirements must be met for a new business model to thrive? \u2022 How can organizations balance innovation with regulatory compliance? By deploying innovative offerings, financial institutions will influence and impact almost every aspect of how customers interact for their financial well-being. Doing so will require collaboration and co-creation with other future-shaping institutions such as tech companies, consumer and retail brands, energy producers, health care organizations and regulators. And perhaps most importantly, these new models are designed to benefit not just financial institutions but individual customers and society as a whole.

The first occurred in June, when stablecoin issuers had to ensure they had the correct authorization to operate in the country.  The second \u2014 what the December deadline is about \u2014 concerns crypto asset service providers (CASPs) such as exchanges, wallet providers and custodians. These firms need to be registered and based in at least one European Union country to apply for a license under MiCA that allows them to operate across the trading bloc.  According to several crypto industry trade associations, a major issue for some national regulators, the so-called national competent authority (NCA), is the short timespan between the deadline and October, when certain regulatory technical standards were finalized. This left just two months to deal with the resulting paperwork and complexity.  \u201cUnder such time pressure it will be very difficult for the responsible NCA to manage the CASP application properly which is crucial for launching effective supervision based upon a well-established regulatory relationship,\u201d reads a letter sent to ESMA last month. The letter was signed by Blockchain for Europe, the European Crypto Initiative, the Electronic Money Association and the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications.  The trade groups requested a \u201cno-action\u201d period of six months. In other words, a hold on enforcement activity so firms yet to receive authorization do not incur sanctions if they continue operating.  So far, ESMA has denied the request, but the MiCA deadline will be considered at a meeting on Dec. 11. While the stay of enforcement is unpalatable, ESMA may be gearing up to offer \u201cguidance\u201d on timing, according to a person familiar with the matter. ESMA declined to comment.  Faced with no alternatives other than an inevitable registration backlog, some firms could be forced to halt crypto operations, Blockchain for Europe\u2019s Kopitsch said.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a license by a certain date you need to basically stop your services in Europe,\u201d Kopitsch said. \u201cImagine what that means. Very bad for business and users will be upset. And it doesn\u2019t make the EU look good.\u201d  Kopitsch identified Ireland, Portugal, Poland and Spain as countries struggling to meet the deadline. Three other people, who asked to remain anonymous, agreed, with Italy, Malta, Cyprus, Lithuania and Belgium also mentioned.  Despite being relatively advanced when it comes to crypto asset regulation, even Germany was mentioned by the Electronic Money Association as a place experiencing problems. The reason being that Germany\u2019s existing crypto framework needs new legislation to meet the MiCA specifications, a process that can take time. Malta also has a crypto regime that needs to be aligned with MiCA, the EMA said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a political process and a legislative process,\u201d Helmut Bauer, a consultant with the Electronic Money Association, said in an interview. \u201cMy understanding is that this has posed a problem for Germany and that process has been delayed. The BaFIN seems to be fairly up to speed, but has to await the legislation.\u201d  BaFIN, Germany's financial regulator, allows banks to custody crypto assets under a framework that was initially based on the Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID) rules.  National regulators also identified the legislative procedure as being the bottleneck in implementation, pointing a finger at their governments.  In Poland, the Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) said the Ministry of Finance is coordinating the process and responsible for meeting the deadlines.  \u201cThe draft of the Polish act on the crypto-asset market crypto-assets received a positive opinion on compliance with EU law and is currently in the European Affairs Committee,\" a spokesperson for the KNF said via email. \"We are aware that the act should be passed by the end of the year, but the Polish Financial Supervision Authority has no direct influence on this [...] Poland is not the only country that has not yet passed a national act and the challenges faced by member states are similar.\u201d  The Portuguese Securities Market Commission said via email: \u201cThe legislative proposal that implements the responsibilities arising from the European MiCA Regulation, as well as the allocation of powers between the CMVM and the Portuguese Central Bank (Banco de Portugal), falls under the jurisdiction of the Portuguese Government and is currently under consideration by the Government.\u201d  A spokesperson for Belgium\u2019s FSMA said via email: \u201cAs a (political) decision on the designation of the competent authorities for MiCA is pending, the FSMA cannot give any input for your questions.\u201d  As for the Central Bank of Ireland, it encourages early engagement from applicants and is engaged in a pre-application process with a number of firms that are seeking authorization under MiCA.  \u201cThe progression of a firm through to the next stage of the process for a CASP application will be dependent on the nature, scale and complexity of the firm and the extent of preparedness of the applicant,\" a central bank spokesperson said by email. \"In general, based on our experience, the best-prepared firms, willing to engage transparently in all stages of the authorisation process, proceed through the process more efficiently.\u201d  A spokesman for Italy\u2019s financial regulator, Commissione Nazionale per le Societ\u00e0 e la Borsa (CONSOB), said via email: \u201cAt this stage your question should be asked to ESMA rather than to Consob as a national authority.\u201d  Germany, Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Romania did not reply by press time.

    "full_text": "Thomas Robinson is the Chief Operating Officer of Domino Data Lab.   In the race to harness AI for meaningful human advancements, one significant challenge is slowing progress: Governance frameworks. AI models spend an average of five to seven months waiting for governance approval before they can be deployed. During this time, model drift and decay can render them ineffective\u2014even obsolete\u2014before they go live. This lag creates a backlog of stalled potential. AI models that could accelerate breakthroughs in healthcare device development, improve financial inclusion, prevent cyberattacks, strengthen national defense and protect economies are held up by governance processes designed for simpler, less dynamic technologies. Without timely deployment, these life-enhancing and life-saving solutions remain too far out of reach, leaving critical human problems unsolved at a time when rapid innovation is more crucial than ever. These delays are especially pronounced in regulated sectors where rigorous governance frameworks are essential for compliance, safety and ethical standards. In healthcare, the FDA provides principles for the use of AI in medical devices. Yet the delays associated with complying with such principles can effectively postpone breakthroughs. In finance, while standards like the Federal Reserve's SR 11-7 Model Risk Management aim to prevent failures in credit scoring and fraud detection, complying with them can delay innovations essential to financial access and security. Similarly, in defense\u2014where swift responses are crucial\u2014extensive testing and evaluation reviews can slow deployment, affecting the nation's ability to quickly respond to evolving threats. Without modernized governance processes built to accommodate AI's complexity and empower people to innovate with confidence, companies risk undermining both their future and the progress of society at large. Research we commissioned from BARC Research shows that 95% of businesses acknowledge the need to overhaul their governance frameworks to keep up with AI's rapid evolution. However, many struggle to modernize, often due to budget constraints, organizational inertia or uncertainty about where to start. Companies in regulated industries have extensive teams, processes and policies to validate models, identify and manage risk and preempt regulatory and supervisory concerns. However, these traditional setups were designed for fewer statistics-based models. They aren't equipped to handle the complexity of modern AI models nor the increase in throughput required as companies add an increasing number of models. Those still relying on outdated tools like SharePoint or Excel for governance are missing critical insights and risking inefficiencies. These tools lack the capabilities to track data, code or business context essential for managing AI models, and they fall short of supporting real-time adjustments or collaboration across teams. Yet many companies continue relying on these outdated tools because they're so deeply embedded in existing workflows and because transitioning to new systems can seem so resource-intensive and complex. To keep pace, companies must rethink their approach and adopt more agile, integrated frameworks that ensure speed and compliance without sacrificing control. Here are three steps essential to their journey: As AI technologies rapidly evolve, so do the associated risks. Governance teams must be continuously trained so they can update their knowledge\u2014especially regarding emerging technologies like generative AI, which introduce new challenges in areas such as bias, data security and ethical use. AI maturity models can help governance teams assess where their organization stands in terms of risk management and operational effectiveness, providing a clear roadmap for improvement. By educating teams on AI-specific risks\u2014from model drift and decay to the complexities of generative AI\u2014businesses can ensure governance processes remain agile and responsive. This knowledge equips teams to anticipate potential issues before they become critical, allowing for proactive risk management. It also enables organizations to balance innovation with responsibility, minimizing risk without slowing down the deployment of new AI technologies. An informed governance team will help the organization stay competitive while maintaining trust and compliance. Many companies are still stuck in a \"throw it over the wall\" mentality where development and governance teams are working in silos\u2014delaying results and increasing risk. Rather than leaving governance as an afterthought, it should be integrated into the model development process from the start, allowing innovations to reach people faster and more securely. Key requirements, documentation and validation metrics should be tracked alongside development efforts. Developers must take responsibility for properly documenting and explaining their work as they go, and governance teams should be able to access a rich set of documentation, metrics and scripted validation for models anytime to eliminate the need to delay model validation and deployment until long after the model has been built. A system of record is critical for speeding up model revalidation and applying the right validation based on business needs. With regulatory pressure like the EU AI Act, it's essential to track which models are in production and which need revalidation. With this system of record, teams can reference previously validated models, reducing the time spent on revalidation by providing access to past data, code and artifacts. By having validators and developers work on the same platform with shared documentation, the governance process is streamlined, ensuring consistency and traceability. This avoids errors caused by moving models between different tools and helps teams deploy models faster, ensuring innovations reach people sooner and remain compliant with AI regulations designed to protect them. Executives need to stop thinking that \"slow and steady\" will win the race in governed AI. The reality is quite the opposite. In this landscape, slow governance isn't conservative\u2014it's reckless because it gets in the way of innovations that can improve lives, safeguard economies and strengthen security. Companies that modernize governance today will be the ones that lead the way for AI-driven advancements that make a tangible, positive impact on society.

    "full_text": "Banking giant Deutsche Bank is building out a layer-2 rollup network on Ethereum with ZKsync technology developed by Matter Labs.  Bloomberg reported the project Wednesday, and a representative for Matter Labs confirmed the story.  The chain will be \"a public and permissioned L2,\" Omar Azhar, the head of business development at Matter Labs, told CoinDesk over Telegram. When asked to elaborate, he referred a reporter to another participant in the project, Memento Blockchain, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Generally \"public permissioned\" means anyone can see what's happening on the network but only authorized participants can do certain things.  The project is a sign of a renewed interest in blockchain technology among institutions, as prices for various cryptocurrencies reach all-time highs. It also echoes the private enterprise blockchains that were in vogue nearly a decade ago. Those systems were disconnected from public chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, though they sometimes borrowed code from them.   According to the Bloomberg report, the bank is creating the layer-2 network in order to address regulatory compliance issues that come with public blockchains in finance. (Regulated institutions have to know who they are dealing with, which is hard in completely open networks like the main Ethereum chain). The bank believes that by creating a layer-2 on top of Ethereum, it will improve the speed of transactions as well as address those compliance needs.  The ZKsync-based rollup could allow banks to experiment with blockchains, and let them select which validators could run said blockchain, Boon-Hiang Chan, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, told Bloomberg. The L2 blockchain may also give regulators \u201csuper admin rights,\u201d allowing them to look more deeply into the movement of funds, Chan said.  Memento Blockchain announced the L2 endeavor on Nov. 6, but it received little attention at the time. The chain is currently in a test network environment. It is built with ZK Stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own blockchains based on ZKsync\u2019s technology.  The L2 is part of Dama 2, a multi-chain initiative led by Deutsche Bank. Dama 2, in turn, is part of the Singapore Monetary Authority's Project Guardian, which is bringing together 24 major financial institutions that are looking into ways to use blockchains to tokenize their assets.

    "full_text": "Beena Ammanath - Global Deloitte AI Institute Leader, Founder of Humans For AI and Author of \"Trustworthy AI\" and \"Zero Latency Leadership.\"   In this era of humans working with machines, being an effective leader with artificial intelligence (AI) takes a range of skills and activities. In this series, I provide an incisive roadmap for leadership in the age of AI. Enterprise AI programs are sometimes viewed as the province of IT, with technology capabilities taken as the driving motivation to pursue AI use cases. Yet, AI investments and deployments need to lead, eventually, to business value, and in this, the chief financial officer (CFO) holds a vital role in AI decision-making and strategy. CFOs contend with AI use cases emerging from every business unit. Some lines of business may be experimenting with applications while others are looking to deploy at scale. Meanwhile, at the enterprise level, executives are contending with how to coordinate AI programs in a way that answers core business questions. In this mix of ambition and investment, CFOs bring a needed financial lens to shape how AI programs impact business outcomes. This was already a challenging mandate in the context of machine learning and more traditional AI. The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) is further complicating the CFO\u2019s role. My organization, Deloitte, found that nearly 40% of organizations report no future plans to create a GenAI strategy, even as 75% of organizations expect the technology to impact talent strategies and business goals. Herein is a multifaceted tension. The potential value in AI is known and the anticipated business impact can be significant, but to access that value and impact, organizations require an integrated strategy that accounts for talent, differentiating applications, targeted goals and a clear path back to ROI. Deploying AI for trusted and secure business impact is a team effort, and for CFOs, the challenge with AI is two-fold. On the one hand, they have an opportunity to leverage AI for their own teams and tasks, which raises common questions about costs, development feasibility and the skilled talent needed to use AI-enabled applications. On the other hand, the CFO holds a strategic role in enterprise AI programs and decision-making, and to help the organization access business value, CFOs are called to lead in lending a strategic and financial perspective across the AI lifecycle. With the introduction of GenAI, CFOs are now faced with a new landscape of capabilities that can drive efficiency and productivity gains. In terms of finance use cases, cash flow forecasting, scenario planning, expense reporting and financial controls management are areas where the thoughtful deployment of GenAI-enabled applications could drive value within finance functions. Meanwhile, GenAI can be integrated with back-office automations, power conversational AI agents for finance inquiries (e.g., chatbot) and contribute to continuous anomaly detection in near-real time. These kinds of applications can expedite finance workflows and help teams improve productivity. The potential has driven significant interest from organizations across industries, but CFOs remain wary of the actual business value. Our poll of CFOs found that 62% anticipated allocating less than 1% of enterprise budget to GenAI in 2025. The hesitation comes alongside known risks with GenAI, such as output accuracy, data privacy, cybersecurity and regulatory compliance. For AI programs, enterprises need to solve for the business strategy and determine if and how to fund use cases, how to do so while managing associated technology and talent costs and how to do so while mitigating risk. The CFO\u2019s changing role is an opportunity to help lead organizations to coordinated, scaled and governed AI deployments that drive intended value. Accessing business value with AI requires a coordinated, enterprise-wide approach that is catalyzed and propelled by leadership. For the CFO, there is an opportunity to bring a financial lens to AI decision-making and investment. CFOs are positioned to focus on ROI and help stakeholders determine how to track and measure impact. They can serve as a scorekeeper emphasizing the necessary connection between AI capabilities and business outcomes. More specifically, the CFO\u2019s role with AI is coming to include: \u2022 Defining The Business Case: CFOs can help stakeholders define the business rationale for their proposed application and scrutinize the AI lifecycle for where and how quickly it can return business benefit. In this, use cases are assessed and prioritized based on the costs and projected returns. \u2022 Establishing Metrics: CFOs can help identify KPIs and other metrics that indicate whether a deployment is driving the intended value. By linking an AI deployment to a strategic business need, the organization can manage and iterate AI use cases to maximize the target ROI. Importantly, while financial metrics tell a value story, CFOs should be mindful of the more intangible value that can result from AI programs, such as upskilling the workforce and differentiating innovation. \u2022 Balancing Costs: AI use cases conceived and developed without constraints (e.g., costs) can be difficult to scale, and CFOs can help stakeholders consider and balance the costs associated with AI deployment, including building or buying an enabling AI model as well as costs for cloud compute, data acquisition and curation, on-premise infrastructure, talent acquisition and employee training, and third-party services. CFOs lead in performing cost-benefit analyses for other enterprise endeavors, and AI is no different. \u2022 Mitigating Risks: CFOs can help identify AI risks that may not be obvious to stakeholders in other roles. They can weigh in on the potential for revenue, cost and compliance risks. They can also help shape governance processes and controls and consider the costs associated with mitigating AI risk, which in turn shapes the business case and value metrics. Ultimately, these kinds of contributions to the AI lifecycle make the CFO even more of a strategic partner to the CEO, CTO and other C-suite leaders. At its core, AI is an enterprise technology that must deliver business impact. The CFO can help their organization navigate decisions to unite AI capabilities with sustainable enterprise value.

    "full_text": "Dean M. Leavitt, CEO and Founder of Boost Payment Solutions, has over 30 years of experience in the electronic payments industry.   As digital transformation intensifies across industries, the strategic question of whether to \u201cbuy, build or partner\u201d has become a pivotal consideration for businesses aiming to modernize payment processes, reduce costs and enhance cash flow. At its core, this choice requires balancing immediate operational goals with long-term business objectives. In the evolving payments landscape\u2014where technology is advancing rapidly, and expectations for seamless integration are rising\u2014payments as a service (PaaS) is emerging as a compelling answer for many businesses. The traditional business-to-business (B2B) payment landscape, long dominated by checks, wires and ACH transactions, is giving way to the efficiencies of commercial cards and virtual cards. These methods offer advantages that extend beyond payment itself, including enhanced working capital and more precise data-sharing capabilities for accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) departments. Many companies still rely on legacy payment methods and systems, not necessarily by choice but due to the complexity of overhauling or integrating new solutions. Now, as enterprise B2B transactions increasingly demand digitized, real-time data, businesses are under pressure to adapt. They face the decision: Should they build an in-house solution, buy a ready-made one or find the right partner? For some businesses, building their own payment infrastructure offers a high degree of customization. They can design workflows tailored to specific requirements and maintain control over every aspect of payment processing. But as the payments landscape becomes increasingly sophisticated, building internally is resource-intensive and requires a long-term commitment to software updates, security and compliance. This approach demands not only initial development but also ongoing investment in talent, technology and regulatory compliance to ensure the solution remains both current and secure. With the swift pace of innovation in payments, it\u2019s a big commitment\u2014one that not every company can sustain. Buying a complete, out-of-the-box solution can be an attractive option for those looking to implement quickly. A well-designed payment solution offers a high degree of functionality and is often built to meet common business needs. However, even the best off-the-shelf systems can lack the flexibility to integrate seamlessly with a company\u2019s existing processes, workflows and data requirements. For businesses that prioritize flexibility and scalability, buying may limit their ability to adapt to new market demands or support various payment methods without significant customization. In this way, the buy option can end up creating more complexity over time as the system requires modifications to keep pace with a company\u2019s evolving needs. That leaves partnering\u2014a model that has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly as PaaS solutions mature. Partnering with a PaaS provider allows businesses to leverage advanced payment technology without shouldering the full cost and responsibility of developing or maintaining it. The PaaS model offers companies the benefits of customization and control without the overhead associated with building or maintaining a payment infrastructure. With PaaS, businesses can work directly with a specialized provider that integrates payment capabilities into their operations, aligning with both existing systems and future growth plans. Partnering with a PaaS provider also comes with strategic advantages. A strong PaaS solution will embed payment processes directly within a business\u2019s operational workflows, offering seamless integration without the need for extensive internal development. In addition, it enables companies to centralize and automate their payment functions, leading to significant reductions in time and resources dedicated to managing AP and AR processes. By automating payment workflows, PaaS solutions simplify the payment process for both payers and suppliers, allowing businesses to focus on their core operations and improve their financial efficiency. Another reason companies are increasingly turning to PaaS is the ability to adapt and scale with ease. As companies expand domestically and internationally, PaaS allows them to support a range of payment types, currencies and regulations without extensive internal development. This flexibility is especially crucial for businesses with a global presence, where cross-border payments, currency exchanges and compliance with international standards are nonnegotiable. A reliable PaaS partner can simplify these complexities, enabling businesses to expand confidently without being weighed down by additional payment infrastructure requirements. While the potential benefits of PaaS are clear, choosing the right partner is essential. Not all PaaS providers offer the same level of flexibility, industry expertise or support. Businesses should seek a partner that can streamline implementation and align with their needs, offering more than just payment processing. The right PaaS provider will have a consultative approach, offering insights into technology, regulatory compliance and security. This guidance is invaluable for companies that want to better future-protect their payment systems, ensuring that their operations remain efficient, secure and capable of scaling with their growth. At my company, we understand that B2B payments are complex and require more than just a one-size-fits-all solution. The right partner must be an expert in B2B, grasping the nuances that come with this business. It\u2019s essential to listen first and tailor the approach to meet your specific needs. A purpose-built solution ensures your business stays flexible, innovative and ahead of the curve, without being constrained by generic solutions. As the payments industry continues to evolve, PaaS solutions will keep playing a key role in helping businesses stay competitive. Automation will lead the charge, centralizing payment workflows, minimizing errors and improving reconciliation processes. This approach not only enhances reporting capabilities but also provides greater control over cash flow, helping businesses operate more efficiently and predictably. In the end, the question of buy, build or partner underscores a company\u2019s commitment to finding the best solution for its needs. For many, partnering with a PaaS provider is a strategic choice that strikes the right balance between operational efficiency and the agility needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world. By choosing a PaaS partner that is aligned with their goals, businesses gain a transformative advantage: They can leverage cutting-edge technology without compromising their core operations, better positioning themselves for success in the years to come.

    "full_text": "Citi\u2019s (C+2.43%) corporate overhaul began bearing fruit this year \u2014 and the bank is hoping it will catch continued windfalls in 2025 and beyond. In 2025, Citi \u201cwill start to see a little bit of benefit from the transformation investments,\u201d chief finance officer Mark Mason said at the 2024 Goldman Sachs (GS+0.87%) Financial Services Conference. That includes revenue growth outpacing expenses into next year. The bank capped off its massive reorganization in the first quarter of the year, and its operating expenses fell 2% in both the second and third quarters \u2014 largely driven by savings associated with its organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, the company said. Last September, Citi undertook its largest reorganization in almost two decades, splitting the bank into five interconnected business units. The reorganization, which was completed in March, was aimed at cutting costs and simplifying the bank\u2019s structure in an effort to turn around the firm\u2019s stock and financial performance to keep pace with its peers. The bank ended up eliminating 7,000 positions, which is expected to generate $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate expenses, Citi CEO Jane Fraser told analysts on a call in April. The restructuring will save the company a projected $2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run-rate in the medium term, Fraser said. \u201cI hope people recognize the progress that we have made,\u201d Mason said, pointing to the bank\u2019s 4%-5% top-line growth outlook for the full year. He said growth is expected to come in on the top end of that range. Shares of Citi were up 1.5% Tuesday morning. The bank\u2019s stock is up more than 37% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s returns. Heading into next year, the bank is expecting continued expenses from its investment in its transformation, data and technology investments, and business-led investments and volume, Mason said. This year, investment banking fees are expected to jump between 25%-30% year over year, Mason said. Investment banking revenue was up 31% in the third quarter. Citi\u2019s markets business could also see a yearly increase in the high teens with strength in equity capital markets, debt capital markets, and mergers and acquisitions, he said. Citi\u2019s expanded partnership with American Airlines (AAL+3.89%) is also \u201ca growth and high-returning business through the cycle,\u201d Mason said. In 2026, Citi will become American\u2019s exclusive co-branded credit card partner, absorbing Barclays\u2019 portfolio. Although the agreement will be \u201cultimately accretive to returns,\u201d Mason said the bank will only begin to see \u201csome modest impact on returns\u201d starting in 2026. In September, Citi\u00a0announced a $25 billion private credit and direct lending program in partnership with Apollo (APO+0.70%). Mason said that transaction is part of a concerted to effort to expand the bank\u2019s offerings. \u201cWe are working this strategy that I think in many ways differentiates us from peers as it relate to that top line,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are incredibly focused on the transformation and continued execution there.\u201d There are, however, areas where Citi is not as far along as Mason would like it to be, particularly when it comes to data. \u201cData is a very broad headache,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I think about customer data, client data, financial reporting data \u2014 I feel very comfortable with that. The work we need to do is largely around how do we improve the timeliness and accuracy as it relates to regulatory reporting.\u201d While it\u2019s a sector-wide challenge, Mason said the bank is undergoing a complicated process to entirely change its approach to data in compliance with regulators. A capabilities test carried out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission and Federal Reserve Board found continuing weaknesses related to data reliability and the firm\u2019s compensating controls. These resulted in \u201cmaterially inaccurate\u201d calculations of the capital and liquidity needed to carry out bankruptcy plans and other distress responses.  In September, Citi was fined $136 million for \u201cinsufficient progress\u201d on improving its data handling. That was on top of a $400 million fine levied against the bank in 2020 for the same issues. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

    "full_text": "Dr. Ozan Ozerk is the founder of OpenPayd. He is a serial entrepreneur with a vested interest in several digital ventures.   Twenty years ago, a U.K. comedy sketch from Little Britain featured a woman dismissing every reasonable customer request with a blunt \"Computer says no.\" I suspect what was humorous then will soon seem eerily prophetic. There's a well-documented problem inherent in artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014biases are inherited from their data, developers and users. Training data may be skewed, amplifying societal inequalities. Programmers and users might unintentionally embed biases into algorithms simply because they're human. And unchecked, this leads to real-world discrimination: \u2022 In the U.S., mortgage refusals are highest among Black people (80% more likely to be rejected than similar white applicants), Native Americans (70%) and Latinos (40%). \u2022 Amazon found its recruitment algorithms favored men due to language usage differences. \u2022 Healthcare models trained predominantly on Caucasian patients resulted in higher misdiagnosis rates for other ethnicities. While these issues are distressing, a much larger problem looms: the proliferation of anti-competitive, discriminatory and manipulative AI behavior that will interfere with all of our lives. And why now? Suddenly, the ease of deploying autonomous AI agents is transforming enterprise AI at breakneck speed. Businesses can now implement AI models with specific actions and data within hours. Finance agents assess risk and compliance; banking agents manage client requests and convert insights into sales; health and sales agents can turn questions into diagnoses and sales. The list is virtually endless. Beyond unintended biases, we now face a new threat\u2014intended bias. Everyone knows businesses routinely segment customers to target the most profitable and use advertising to influence behavior. But AI-driven insights could accelerate and deepen these practices, permanently altering the consumer landscape. Profiling customers will become more sophisticated by integrating data from partners and social media. It may soon be effortless to score individuals on creditworthiness, honesty, political stance, social standing, sexual orientation, beliefs and financial status. Sound familiar? It should\u2014this de facto social scoring resembles China's pilot schemes monitoring and regulating citizen and corporate behavior, which they are looking to roll out nationwide. Now, imagine such a system operated by companies buying and selling your information, potentially acting on it\u2014pricing products based on your ability to pay, denying finance due to algorithmic risk scores linked to your postcode, race or financial standing and manipulating your behavior using subconscious cues targeting your vulnerabilities. Consumers might face issues ranging from AI service denial (AISD)\u2014\"computer says no\"\u2014to subconscious AI manipulation. This step change would affect all of us. The real question is how to respond. Globally, we've seen two distinct approaches: controlling the process or policing the outcomes. Europe has opted for top-down control. The European AI Act represents these concerns with a stringent regulatory regime that began on August 1, with a phased rollout over three years. Over 150 companies, including Siemens, Heineken, Renault and Airbus, expressed concerns about potential regulatory overkill. The regulation is indeed strict: Violations can result in fines up to 35 million euros or 7% of turnover, whichever is greater. The most interesting part is the practices in the EU AI Act in Article 5, which are completely outlawed: 1. Subliminal techniques: Methods that distort a person's ability to make informed decisions. 2. Exploitation of vulnerabilities: Targeting individuals or groups based on age, disability, social/economic situation or associations. 3. Social evaluation: Creating inferred personality characteristics or social scores. 4. Facial recognition: Unauthorized use of facial recognition technologies. 5. Biometric categorization: Deducing race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life and orientation through biometric data. In contrast, the U.S. and U.K. focus on outcomes. For example, the U.K.'s regulation is minimal\u2014termed a \"principles-based,\" sector-focused approach. Essentially, the government delegated AI governance to existing regulators, issued guidelines and stepped back, hoping each regulator would manage effectively. The argument is that strict regulation might disadvantage countries by limiting AI's benefits, potentially allowing less-regulated nations like China and the U.S. to gain the upper hand. The EU, however, feels differently. Drago\u0219 Tudorache, a member of the European Parliament, said of the legislation that the EU AI Act \"safeguards \u2026 our citizens and our democracies against any abuses of technology by public authorities.\" That means every one of these practices outlawed in the EU is currently fair game in the U.S. and U.K. It\u2019s not so much light-touch regulation as nearly invisible, and perhaps the best path lies between these two extremes. And there\u2019s one further challenge. Even if some of these practices are banned under existing laws in the U.S. and U.K., how will regulators know these practices are occurring? The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), responsible for overseeing financial services and markets, has issued AI guidelines stating that existing laws cover discriminatory practices, and they will enforce them as necessary. However, AI models often conceal underlying algorithms, making it nearly impossible to determine intention, let alone liability. There are no easy answers, and no magic solution will equally satisfy businesses and consumers. Perhaps a middle ground is appropriate, given that none of us truly know how this will unfold. Consider the numerous stories (examples 1, 2, 3 and 4) about bias in image generation models\u2014gender bias, race bias and cultural stereotypes. Image generation serves as a useful benchmark to monitor AI progress, both in image quality and in understanding how algorithms interpret the world. Testing an updated model released last month, I requested an image of a diverse group of protesters outside the U.K. House of Parliament holding a sign saying \"Stop AISD now!\" It looked impressively realistic, but what came back was best described as a sea of white Europeans. It seems the computer still says no. The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

    "full_text": "Igor Epshteyn is the CEO and President of Coherent Solutions.   Modern large language models (LLMs) push automation and quality boundaries in business operations by converting natural language into text, insights and code. They help employees free up more time and increase productivity. This article provides my experience with LLM implications, its deployment on a custom project and the risks you need to know to make informed decisions to keep up with competitors. LLMs are just one of many facets of AI. They allow you to drive transformative changes in your organization's operational workflows, and they're adaptable across various sectors\u2014especially where decisions at various levels rely on quick and efficient analysis of massive amounts of data. During a 2024 NMDP BioTherapies webinar, healthcare experts discussed AI's role in successfully analyzing genetic data for stem cell donor matching\u2014improving the speed and accuracy with which life-saving transplants find patients. For life science companies, LLMs are instrumental in robust solutions that analyze various clinical cases for adverse events. They help automate management pipelines to analyze PDF documents, pull out essential information and add guardrails to make sure AI is applied responsibly. For some financial institutions, AI has helped analyze transaction patterns and reduce false positive fraud alerts by 50%. This minimizes disruptions from incorrect alerts, allowing risk management teams to focus on real threats. In addition, AI-powered virtual assistants like Bank of America's Erica provide personalized financial advice, speed up response times to customer queries and lower support costs. Manufacturers can use LLMs to analyze production data such as output metrics, performance and quality control results. They can use insights to predict equipment failures and recommend timely maintenance schedules. Likewise, manufacturers of fitness wearables like Fitbit use advanced AI to provide users with training insights and tailored recommendations based on user data such as heart rate, activity patterns or sleep quality. AI speeds up development cycles by helping engineers write code and automate testing and debugging. LLMs help them quickly analyze technical documentation to find relevant information. Besides, organizations that rely on IT support and customer service teams can respond to customer inquiries faster, and according to IBM research, AI can help cut support costs by 30%. When choosing LLMs for your project, you want to strike a balance between control and convenience. Popular models like OpenAI's GPT-4, Cohere's Command R and Anthropic's Claude v3.5 Sonnet support accessible cloud APIs. These models offer easy integration with your existing systems and are scalable enough to meet various business goals. They receive continuous updates from providers, ensuring access to the latest AI advancements. Finance and healthcare businesses might choose to host LLMs on the private cloud for improved data governance and compliance with privacy regulations. You can employ the same models as mentioned above for private data by using Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock. Moreover, Meta's LLaMA 2 and 3, as well as Google's Gemma and Mistral models, will allow you to tailor the environment to your business needs, combining greater data oversight with the flexibility of a cloud. A traditional on-premises deployment enhances privacy compliance, data control and information security by keeping all data\u2014including sensitive information\u2014within your organization's infrastructure. This setup requires a license for models like GPT-3 or allows the option to use open-source alternatives. Don't dismiss LLMs from your project solely due to potential risks; instead, identify the risk factors and implement effective AI safeguards. Open-source LLMs offer flexibility and customization but come with security concerns. Without vigilant maintenance, they may expose sensitive data to cyber threats. Additionally, their training data is often not fully anonymized, heightening the risk of data exposure and potential intellectual property violations. As a decentralized community maintains these models rather than a dedicated team, their performance consistency may vary. Conversely, proprietary LLMs typically offer robust security features but still pose data privacy and control risks. Using these models involves sharing sensitive data with a third-party provider, which could lead to regulatory penalties if a breach occurs. LLMs also lack transparency regarding their training data and how datasets are formed. Be mindful of potential bias and fairness issues and consider a human-in-the-loop approach, where specialists review and manage the model's output. LLMs are most effective when used to streamline complex processes and drive innovation. To leverage these models responsibly, prioritize data governance\u2014especially in highly regulated industries. Equally important are transparency and ethical AI practices. By following this approach, you can build trust with stakeholders and clients while fostering sustainable growth for your organization.

    "full_text": "Shagun Malhotra | Ex-Fortune 100 auditor, process consultant & CEO of SkyStem who designed ART, a month-end close solution for accountants.    As businesses expand, the adage goes that so does the complexity of reporting and the overall month-end close process. But what about smaller teams with just a few staff members for small businesses? Well, an accountant, no matter the business size, will have many duties that need to be completed during the hectic month-end closing. Whether it\u2019s reconciling accounts, verifying every single transaction or generating reports, there is a lot to do. Additionally, the month-end process is not something that a business can take a casual approach to. A small business might need some financial support via a loan from a bank, but if the documentation to prove the business\u2019s financial state isn\u2019t there, then the bank is unlikely to lend money\u2014they can\u2019t rely on their instincts; they need hard evidence. However, there are some automation tools out there that can really help in terms of identifying and eliminating errors quickly and hopefully saving countless hours. The demand is there for this change\u201440% of respondents in an EY survey said they want a higher degree of automation in the accounts payable, accounts receivable and general accounting processes. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how smaller teams can use automation to make the month-end close less of an ordeal. Tracking and recording bills received and paid remains one of the big hurdles in the month-end close. This can make up the bulk of the work and cut down time if you can simplify the process. After all, even though companies at the top of their game might be able to close in under five days, many organizations need on average 6.4 or more. Accounts payable automation software reduces the possibility of errors with cloud-based solutions, allowing you to track bills and automatically code recurring transactions. This type of platform can even allow vendors to send invoices directly into the system or even with a simple drag-and-drop feature to import data en masse. The software will then automatically match these records to the bank and respective vendor statements. Features such as a closing calendar, task assignments and progress tracking streamline the workflow, eliminating reliance on multiple spreadsheets and external tools. These platforms enable cross-system transparency and consolidation without the need for extensive integration. Disclosure management tools can also be a great help when it comes to optimizing the reporting process, particularly when there is more scrutiny from regulatory requirements. These tools can help to facilitate the organization of financial disclosures with data being validated no matter the format, whether it be Word, Excel or XBRL. They also allow for real-time updates, so that compliance with accounting standards is guaranteed. Having one enterprise resource planning (ERP) system can allow for an easy and simple workflow that might help a smaller team. By operating within this interface, teams can make data entry, validation and task management much more straightforward, meaning that the month-end process can be carried out without the need for extensive manual input. This type of automation means that teams can be guided through each task with preset workflows. It means that there isn\u2019t the same need for multiple data verification steps as there would be if you were switching between multiple systems. It should be noted that this does mean that functionality would be impaired for teams needing cross-platform access, but it\u2019s ideal for a smaller team that is working within one specific ERP system, as there is more control and accuracy for monthly reporting. Additionally, small teams can make use of key performance indicator (KPI) dashboards for real-time monitoring, so that they can track essential metrics such as error rates, reconciliation status and close progress. This gives a good overview and helps ensure there is a clear picture of their month-end close\u2019s efficiency, helping them to identify and address any issues immediately. With the combination of automation and dashboards for performance tracking, small finance teams can streamline their month-end processes and reduce errors while gaining valuable insights. The crucial aspect underlining everything here is there isn\u2019t the need for substantial manpower or particularly complicated software setups. With tools for disclosure management and ERP-based automation in place, smaller accounting teams within businesses can simplify complex tasks while maintaining compliance and freeing up team members to spend time on more valuable tasks.

    "full_text": "As cyber threats evolve and regulatory\r\npressures increase, Zilla Security executives outline how AI-driven innovation,\r\nproactive governance, and new compliance strategies will shape the future of\r\nidentity management.  Deepak Taneja,\r\nCEO & Co-founder, Zilla Security  \"In 2025,\r\nidentity security will reach an inflection point as attackers focus on\r\nexploiting overlooked dependencies in identity ecosystems, such as interlinked\r\nmachine identities that create excessive entitlements.\u00a0 While\r\norganizations have made strides in managing secrets like credentials and\r\ncertificates, the rapid growth of interconnected systems will present new\r\nvulnerabilities. Attackers are now targeting overlooked configurations and\r\nshared resources to bypass traditional defenses.  \"CISOs must\r\nshift their strategies from simply managing secrets to actively identifying\r\ndependencies that create excessive entitlements, leveraging AI to ease the\r\nmanagement and monitoring of identity entitlements to preempt attacks, and\r\ndeveloping playbooks for quickly remediating stolen secrets. The future of\r\nidentity security will depend on not just controlling credentials and managing\r\nentitlements, but anticipating where attackers will strike next.\"  Nitin Sonawane,\r\nChief Product Officer & Co-founder, Zilla Security  \"In 2025, AI\r\nand machine learning (AI/ML) will drive a change in identity governance,\r\nautomating complex processes like role management and access reconciliation.\r\nThese technologies will analyze historical data and usage patterns to make a\r\nmeaningful dent to the manual tasks required and the frequent rubber stamping.\r\nAI will predict access related risks and help mitigate them.  \"However,\r\nthe growing footprint of AI/ML across the enterprise introduces new risks:\r\nopaque decision-making models can make it impossible to predict which users can\r\nsee what data and compromised AI systems could magnify vulnerabilities. CISOs\r\nneed to implement robust governance systems to maintain oversight for critical\r\naccess decisions, and govern AI projects across the enterprise to reduce the\r\nrisk of data loss. AI/ML promises significant efficiency gains but must be\r\ndeployed within secure, transparent frameworks to realize its full\r\npotential.\"  Mark Jaffe, VP\r\nStrategy and Marketing, Zilla Security  \"2025 will\r\nmark a record-breaking year for identity governance and administration (IGA)\r\ndeployments, driven by a perfect storm of resource constraints, regulatory\r\ndemands, and hybrid IT complexity. Many organizations face operational fatigue\r\nfrom managing fragmented identity processes across legacy on-premises and\r\nmodern cloud systems. This breaking point will prompt a shift from the long\r\nacceptance of manual identity governance process to identifying automation to\r\nreduce the growing burden on identity security and governance teams.  \"To\r\ncapitalize on this moment, CISOs must prioritize tools that offer\r\nfast-time-value, unified visibility across highly distributed environments,\r\npre-integrated workflows to accelerate deployment, and modular designs that\r\nscale with future needs. Expect IGA to evolve from a niche IT tool to a\r\nfoundational element of enterprise-wide risk and compliance management,\r\naddressing not just IT needs but broader operational resilience.\"  Ryan Burke, VP\r\nSales, Zilla Security  \"In 2025,\r\nwe'll see a surge in identity-related regulatory requirements across both new\r\nand traditionally regulated industries. Sectors like retail, aviation, and\r\nlogistics will adopt identity compliance mandates, while existing industries\r\nlike finance and healthcare will face increasing scrutiny at regional and state\r\nlevels. For example, state-level regulations akin to NYDFS are already creating\r\na patchwork of obligations that extend beyond federal standards.  \"For CISOs,\r\nthis means compliance will no longer be a contained IT issue-it will require\r\nenterprise-wide coordination and automation to scale. Identity governance\r\nsolutions must evolve to deliver real-time compliance status, centralized audit\r\nreadiness, and flexible frameworks to adapt to overlapping mandates. To stay\r\nahead, CISOs should form cross-functional compliance teams and implement\r\nproactive monitoring tools to detect non-compliance before regulators do.\" ##"

    "full_text": "When Michael Saylor announced MicroStrategy's conversion of $250 million in Treasury reserves to bitcoin in August 2020, Wall Street analysts dismissed it as a reckless gamble. \"Superior to cash,\" Saylor declared of bitcoin at the time, drawing skepticism from traditional banking circles. Yet today, those same banks that sneered at bitcoin's corporate adoption are now scrambling to participate in bitcoin-collateralized lending as they race to capitalize on its superior characteristics as institutional-grade collateral and a thriving product-market fit. Traditional collateral, such as real estate, requires manual appraisals, subjective valuations and complex legal frameworks that vary by jurisdiction. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers instant verification of collateral backing through public blockchain data, 24/7 real-time settlement and liquidation capabilities, uniform quality regardless of geography or counterparty, and the ability to enforce lending terms programmatically. When a lender realizes that they can instantly verify and potentially liquidate bitcoin collateral at 3 a.m. on a Sunday \u2014 while real estate sits waiting for manual appraisals, subjective valuations, and potential evictions\u2014 there will be no going back. 1. Traditional banking bends the knee to bitcoin. MicroStrategy's (MSTR) approach fundamentally altered how public companies view bitcoin as a treasury asset. Rather than simply holding bitcoin, the firm has pioneered a treasury model of leveraging public markets to amplify its crypto position \u2014 issuing convertible notes and at the market equity offerings to finance purchases of bitcoin. This strategy has allowed MicroStrategy to significantly outperform spot bitcoin ETFs by harnessing the same financial engineering that made traditional banks powerful, but with bitcoin as the underlying asset instead of traditional financial instruments and real estate. As a result, one of my predictions for 2025 is that MSTR will announce a 10-for-1 stock split to further its market share as it will allow many more investors to purchase shares and options contracts. MicroStrategy's playbook demonstrates just how deeply bitcoin has penetrated traditional corporate finance. I also believe financial services built around bitcoin are set to explode in popularity as long-term holders and new investors look to get more out of their positions. We expect to see rapid growth in bitcoin-collateralized loans and yield-generating products for bitcoin holders worldwide. Moreover, there\u2019s an almost poetic answer to why bitcoin-backed loans have become so popular \u2014 they are a true representation of financial inclusion, with a business owner in Medell\u00edn facing the same collateral requirements and interest rates as one in Madrid. Each person\u2019s bitcoin carries identical properties, verification standards and liquidation processes. This standardization strips away the arbitrary risk premiums historically imposed on borrowers in emerging markets. Traditional banks marketed \"global reach\" for decades while maintaining vastly different lending standards across regions. Now, bitcoin-backed lending exposes this inherited inefficiency for what it is: a relic of an antiquated financial system. 2. Borders fall as capital flows freely. Nations are entering a new era of competition for bitcoin business and capital. Consequently, we expect to see new tax incentives specifically targeting bitcoin investors and businesses in 2025. These will happen alongside fast-track visa programs for crypto entrepreneurs and regulatory frameworks designed to attract bitcoin companies. Nations historically competed for manufacturing bases or regional headquarters. Now they compete for bitcoin mining operations, trading venues and custody infrastructure. El Salvador's bitcoin treasury position represents early experimentation with nation-state bitcoin reserves. While experimental, their moves and the recent proposal for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve forces traditional financial centers to confront bitcoin's role in sovereign finance. Other nations will study and attempt to replicate these frameworks, preparing their own initiatives to attract bitcoin-denominated capital flows. 3. Banks race against obsolescence. In debt markets, necessity drives innovation. Public companies now routinely tap bond markets and convertible notes to finance bitcoin-related transactions. The practice has transformed bitcoin from a speculative asset into a cornerstone of corporate treasury management. Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings and Semler Scientific have been successful in following MicroStrategy's lead, and the market has rewarded them. This is the most important signal for treasury managers and CEOs. Bitcoin\u2019s got their attention now. Meanwhile, bitcoin lending markets have come a long way over the last two years. With the deadwood being cleared away, serious institutional lenders now demand proper collateral segregation, transparent custody arrangements and conservative loan-to-value ratios. This standardization of risk management practices attracts precisely the type of institutional capital that previously sat on the sidelines. More regulatory clarity out of the U.S. should open the door for more banks to get involved in bitcoin financial products \u2014 this will benefit consumers the most, with new capital and competition driving rates down and making bitcoin-backed loans even more compelling. 4. Bitcoin and crypto M&A intensifies. As regulatory clarity emerges through the SAB 121 resolution addressing crypto custody and other guidance, banks will face a critical choice: build or buy their way into the growing market of bitcoin & lending. As a result, we predict at least one of the top 20 U.S. banks will acquire a crypto business in the coming year. Banks will want to move fast, and development timelines for cryptocurrency infrastructure stretch beyond competitive windows, while established firms already process billions in monthly volume through battle-tested systems. These operational platforms represent years of specialized development that banks cannot rapidly replicate. The acquisition premium shrinks against the opportunity cost of delayed market entry. The confluence of operational maturity, regulatory clarity and strategic necessity creates natural conditions for the banking industry\u2019s acquisition of cryptocurrency capabilities.These moves mirror previous financial technology integration patterns in which banks historically acquired electronic trading platforms rather than building internal capabilities. 5. Public markets validate bitcoin infrastructure. The cryptocurrency industry is poised for a breakthrough year in public markets. We expect to see at least one high-profile crypto initial public offering exceeding $10 billion in valuation in the U.S. Major digital asset companies have built sophisticated institutional service layers with revenue streams that now mirror those of traditional banks, processing billions in daily transactions, managing substantial custody operations with rigorous compliance frameworks and generating stable fee income from regulated activities. The next chapter of finance will therefore be written not by those who resist this change but by those who recognize that their very survival depends on embracing it.

    "full_text": "Established CEXs will have to compete with TradFi banks and brokers As the new year kicks off, it\u2019s hard to recall another time when the crypto market and general mood surrounding the sector has felt so buoyant. Unlike previous cycles, it feels less tenuous and more sustainable this time around. The certainty of regulation and the influx of institutional investment and interest means that crypto\u2019s future is now becoming inextricably tied in with TradFi. But what does this mean for the OG players, the CEXs that have weathered the regulatory storm for so long? 2025 represents the first time that the established market of crypto-native operators, comprising industry titans such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and others, will have to compete with TradFi banks and brokers. In the EU, the MiCA regulation has created a smooth path for ESMA-licensed banks and brokers to expand into crypto-assets while ensuring that crypto-native firms and newcomers must undergo a full licensing procedure. In the US, many firms are now looking to the Trump administration to initiate executive orders in favor of the crypto sector from his earliest days in office. Such a move would bring long-awaited regulatory clarity to the US crypto sector, where firms including Coinbase and Binance have long battled with the SEC under Biden\u2019s tenure. Trump now seems set to offer some sweet relief \u2013 but it comes at a potential cost. Once the new administration clears the rocks from the runway for crypto-native firms, it\u2019s clear for everyone, including traditional banks, brokers, and fintechs. Robinhood, a firm that straddles the boundary of fintech and crypto, added 420,000 customers during crypto\u2019s post-election surge last November. So, some key questions. Will customers continue to use exchanges when they can just as easily trade crypto via their bank or brokerage account? How will established CEXs maintain their market position and continue to acquire new customers in this newly favorable regulatory environment? While a suddenly crowded marketplace does introduce unprecedented challenges for the established crypto sector, there are several factors that still work in its favor. Firstly, most banks and brokers seeking to launch a retail crypto offering aren\u2019t necessarily looking to bootstrap liquidity from scratch. A far quicker route to market is to tap into established pools of liquidity under the hood through partnerships with crypto brokers and liquidity aggregators. For instance, in May of last year, Bitpanda extended a partnership with Austrian bank Raiffeisen to 55 banks across the country in anticipation of the new MiCA rules. Via arrangements such as these, centralized exchanges that can maintain liquidity will remain critical hubs for a growing industry, facilitating large-scale trades and playing a key role in price discovery. Another USP for crypto exchanges in an increasingly busy market is industry and technological expertise. Crypto has plenty of unique characteristics, including the underlying blockchain technology along with innovations such as staking and DeFi. In March 2024, crypto custodian Taurus partnered with staking platform Lido to allow Swiss banks to offer liquid staking to their customers. With the benefit of an established reputation, industry-wide networks, and connectivity, CEXs can also play a role as a trusted partner for both institutional and retail users who are navigating these unfamiliar waters. While the advent of regulation invariably paves the way for competition, the benefits work both ways. Particularly for US crypto firms that have spent years either fighting the SEC or attempting to stay below its radar, there is now an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. Exchanges and other operators can demonstrate that they operate to the same standards of compliance and transparency as any other financial institution, with comparable freedom to operate. While the crypto industry deserves a moment to celebrate, the reality is that the landscape is likely to shift pretty quickly following the inauguration on January 20, with an influx of new operators and partnerships. Established crypto firms will need to stake out their USP in this newly competitive market, with an opportunity to act as a bridge between the worlds of traditional and emerging finance.

    "full_text": "Market sentiment may have turned, but the future still remains unclear for fintech IPOs. (Photo by ... [+] Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) As we tuck into eggnog and festive cheer, it\u2019s worth taking a pause to look at what might lie ahead for fintech in 2025, especially in the IPO market. After years of turbulence, fintech companies may finally be gearing up for a resurgence in public markets. The confidential IPO filing by Chime Financial and recent activity from companies like Stripe, Klarna, and Circle signal that the fintech sector might be preparing for a comeback in 2025. This potential wave of IPOs comes after a period of inflated valuations in 2021, a subsequent market correction, and investor skepticism that cast doubt on the long-term viability of many fintechs. But why now? What factors are aligning to make 2025 a potential inflection point for fintech IPOs, and what lessons can be learned from the past? The fintech IPO boom in 2021 brought companies like Robinhood, Affirm, and SoFi into the public eye. These companies promised to disrupt traditional financial services, and for a while, investors were on board. However, rising interest rates, profitability concerns, and a broader tech sector sell-off led to a steep decline in fintech valuations. Fast forward to today, and the narrative may be shifting. Chime\u2019s confidential filing with U.S. regulators hints at a renewed confidence in the public markets. Klarna, the Swedish buy-now-pay-later giant, is reportedly planning for a U.S. IPO in 2025 after years of shifting its focus from hypergrowth to profitability. Meanwhile, Stripe, one of the most anticipated fintech IPOs of the last decade, has been steadily preparing for a potential public debut after raising just under $700 million earlier this year in a funding round that valued it at about $65 billion. The year 2025 could mark a turning point for fintech IPOs as broader market dynamics shift in favor of public listings. Recent years have been challenging for IPOs across sectors, with rising interest rates and economic uncertainty dampening investor appetite for new public offerings. The fintech sector, in particular, faced significant headwinds, as overhyped valuations and shaky business models led to disappointing post-IPO performances. However, the IPO market is showing signs of reopening. As equity markets stabilize and investor confidence rebuilds, fintechs are positioning themselves to take advantage of improved conditions. Fintechs are using this window to refine their operations and ensure that when they go public, they present stronger fundamentals and clearer paths to profitability. By timing their moves for 2025, companies like Chime, Klarna, and Stripe aim to align with a more receptive market and avoid the pitfalls that plagued earlier public offerings. The optimism around 2025 is warranted, but fintechs considering an IPO would do well to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors. Robinhood, for example, saw explosive growth during the pandemic, only to struggle as interest rates rose and trading volumes declined, revealing its reliance on short-term trends. Similarly, the abrupt halt of Ant Group\u2019s IPO in 2020 highlighted the importance of regulatory readiness, a crucial factor as fintechs navigate complex compliance landscapes. These cautionary tales underscore the need for strategic preparation and adaptability. Stripe\u2019s potential IPO could be the crown jewel of the 2025 fintech wave. As a global leader in payments infrastructure, Stripe\u2019s consistent growth and profitability make it a standout in a sector that has often struggled to prove its worth. Its success could set a positive tone for other fintechs and signal to investors that the sector is ready to deliver on its promises. Stripe\u2019s recent fundraising efforts have also highlighted a new trend: fintechs opting for private capital to buy time until public market conditions improve. This strategy could pave the way for more fintechs to go public with stronger fundamentals and healthier balance sheets. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, is another fintech preparing for a potential IPO in 2025. Circle\u2019s business model thrives on the interest it earns from the reserves backing USDC, particularly as crypto prices and market activity rise. With USDC widely used for trading, payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Circle has positioned itself as a key player in the growing digital asset ecosystem. As investor interest in crypto rebounds, Circle\u2019s IPO could serve as a barometer for how traditional markets view the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. The IPO landscape isn\u2019t limited to the U.S. In China, Ant Group\u2019s delayed IPO may still be a possibility, albeit with regulatory hurdles to overcome. In Southeast Asia, regional fintechs like Grab and Sea Group have already paved the way with public listings, and more could follow as the region\u2019s fintech ecosystem matures. Meanwhile, in Europe, Klarna\u2019s potential U.S. IPO reflects a broader shift in strategy among European fintechs. After years of focusing on aggressive customer acquisition, Klarna has recalibrated its priorities toward profitability\u2014a move that investors are likely to welcome as market conditions improve. As 2025 approaches, investors considering fintech IPOs should pay attention to the profitability metrics of companies entering the market. Clear paths to profitability will likely attract more interest, while differentiation in technology, customer experience, or niche focus will set successful fintechs apart. Navigating regulatory landscapes will also be critical, particularly for cross-border operations. The potential for fintech IPOs in 2025 reflects a sector that is growing up. After years of turbulence, the next wave of public offerings could redefine how we view fintech\u2019s role in the broader financial ecosystem. Companies like Chime, Klarna, Stripe, and Circle are leading the charge, and their success or failure will set the tone for others to follow. As these companies prepare to enter the public spotlight, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. For fintechs, 2025 represents an opportunity to prove that their innovations are not just disruptive but sustainable. For investors, it\u2019s a chance to bet on the future of finance\u2014a future that promises to be as exciting as it is uncertain.  One Community.

    "full_text": "How could ideas from fashion, arts, sports, sciences or more be integrated into family offices? In an era where specialization dominates professional discourse, the concept of consilience offers a a very different approach to organizational management. While many organizations still struggle with departmental silos, more are adopting an integrated approach to knowledge. This convergence of knowledge, championed by E.O. Wilson in his 1998 book Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, discusses methods that have been used to unite the sciences and might in the future unite them with the humanities. By integrating knowledge across disciplines - from behavioral economics to organizational psychology - it\u2019s possible to create a powerful competitive advantage. Here lies the opportunity for family offices, as economically powerful yet smaller and potentially more agile organizations. By breaking down traditional barriers between disciplines, family offices uncover innovative solutions to complex challenges that single-domain expertise simply cannot address. Consilience draws from both scientific and philosophical traditions, emphasizing the integration of diverse perspectives to achieve a holistic understanding. This principle has been applied in fields ranging from neuroscience to economics. Modern thought leaders like Yale Economics Professor and Nobel Laureate, Robert Shiller, who used neuroscience to explore narrative economics, demonstrating how multidisciplinary approaches can unveil deeper insights. In the context of family offices, consilience is certainly relevant. Family offices must integrate expertise across finance, law, governance, philanthropy, and investment to ensure cohesive management of assets and family dynamics. Family offices can leverage diverse insights for enhanced decision-making by fostering cross-departmental collaboration. Family office management inherently requires a multifaceted approach that combines expertise from various fields. The successful operation of family offices depends on seamlessly integrating insights from finance, law, taxation, and investment management. But beyond just looking at various facets of one family office, by bringing in external perspectives and sharing knowledge with others, this idea becomes even more powerful. 1. Enhancing Risk Management Family offices often prioritize investment risk management, yet gaps persist in cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and human capital management\u200b. A consilient approach integrates diverse legal, technological, and strategic perspectives to mitigate these risks comprehensively. For instance, cyber risks, a growing concern globally, can be tackled effectively by combining IT expertise with robust legal frameworks and family-wide training initiatives\u200b. 2. Improving Long-Term Planning Aligning family values with long-term objectives is critical. Consilience allows family offices to map future trends across disciplines, incorporating demographic shifts, economic narratives, and technological advancements. This foresight supports effective estate planning, intergenerational wealth transfer, and sustainable philanthropic endeavors. 3. Governance and Leadership Implementing consilient strategies demands strong leadership. Leaders must articulate a family\u2019s vision and foster an environment of continuous education. A broad knowledge base across disciplines equips leaders to adapt to dynamic environments and inspire collaborative efforts. As highlighted in recent studies, diverse educational backgrounds in leadership enhance decision-making resilience\u200b. Comprehensive Decision-Making: Integrating insights from varied fields enables family offices to craft strategies that are both innovative and grounded in reality. Resilient Investment Strategies: By incorporating economic, social, and technological insights, family offices can build portfolios that are both adaptive and aligned with long-term goals. Enhanced Risk Mitigation: Multi-perspective risk analysis ensures that family offices effectively address financial, operational, and reputational vulnerabilities\u200b. In today\u2019s business environment leaders constantly need to educate themselves in a broad frame view to know what's going on to make sense of what's around themselves rather than solving problems according to a formula. Strong leadership is crucial for implementing consilience-based strategies in family offices. Leaders must be open to new ideas and perspectives, possess the ability to communicate effectively, articulate the family's vision, and inspire support across all stakeholders. The importance of broad education in leadership cannot be overstated - interestingly, while over 98% of S&P 500 CEOs in 2004 held bachelor's degrees, only 28.5% majored in business, highlighting the value of diverse educational backgrounds. Effective leadership in this context requires continuous education and exposure to various disciplines to navigate the complex and dynamic environment of family office management. Leaders must foster an environment that encourages collaborative work across departments and organizations, promoting the exchange of diverse perspectives and leading to more comprehensive decision-making processes. Organizations that successfully implement consilience-based approaches typically create incentive structures that reward cross-departmental collaboration and research. This approach ensures that different viewpoints are not only valued but actively sought out, resulting in more informed and effective decision-making processes that benefit the entire family office operation. The complexity of managing wealth in today\u2019s environment demands more than just expertise in finance or law. Embracing consilience is not merely a strategy but a necessity. It empowers family offices to transcend traditional silos, build a view of the world to invest towards and foster a culture of integrated thinking and proactive management. By adopting a consilient approach, family offices can evolve into adaptive, forward-thinking entities that not only preserve wealth but also build a legacy of thoughtful, informed stewardship.

    "full_text": "George Tsarouchas, CEO & Founder at Dialectica.   Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries by processing vast amounts of data, automating routine tasks and enabling quicker decision-making. While AI\u2019s capabilities can be transformative, it\u2019s important to recognize that human insights remain indispensable, particularly in strategic and investment decision-making. Although AI can provide valuable insights through data-driven analysis, it still largely lacks the nuance required for more strategic decision-making. Information sourced from public platforms\u2014available to all\u2014may lack accuracy and depth. Misinformation, incomplete perspectives and anonymous or unverifiable contributors can make it difficult to depend solely on these sources for sound decision-making. In the expert network industry, I've found this synergy to be especially important. AI can help connect clients with suitable experts quickly by assessing data, but humans bring the nuanced understanding of specific client needs and industry context that can ensure the highest-quality matches. The combined strengths of AI-driven analysis and human strategic insight can allow expert networks to offer comprehensive solutions that are both data-informed and context-aware, thereby creating more impactful decision-making for clients. AI has significantly impacted industries like finance, healthcare, marketing and the expert network industry by enhancing efficiency, accuracy and strategic capabilities. In finance, AI-driven algorithms can predict market trends, optimize portfolios and automate trading processes, helping institutions achieve better returns and reduce risks. AI's uses in finance also include fraud detection and compliance checks to enhance security and regulatory adherence. In healthcare, AI has revolutionized patient care by analyzing medical records, forecasting outcomes and recommending personalized treatments. For example, AI algorithms assist in early diagnosis of diseases by analyzing medical images, while predictive models can help healthcare providers improve patient management and optimize resource allocation. The expert network industry has also benefited from AI's capabilities. AI-driven platforms can help streamline the matching process between clients and experts by analyzing project requirements and expert profiles. In my experience, this typically leads to faster, more precise connections that help ensure clients receive the most relevant insights for their specific needs. Additionally, AI tools can analyze feedback and engagement metrics to improve the quality of expert recommendations and enhance client satisfaction, contributing to overall growth and efficiency in the expert network market. However, AI\u2019s reliance on historical data also highlights its limitations. AI systems are inherently data-driven, sometimes reflecting biases present in the data. This dependence can result in biased outcomes, particularly when historical inequalities are embedded in the datasets. Furthermore, AI lacks the ability to grasp the broader context of decisions, which can lead to missing out on critical factors like cultural, social and ethical implications that human experts are often uniquely equipped to handle. This limitation highlights the irreplaceable value of human insights in decision-making processes. In my work sourcing experts for companies across industries, I have found that having access to human expertise can bring nuanced knowledge, experience and contextual understanding that AI cannot currently replicate. This insight can be particularly valuable in strategic decision-making, where human intuition, real-time observations and interpersonal skills are especially important. A knowledgeable expert should be capable of identifying emerging trends, foreseeing disruptions, and assessing risks and opportunities beyond what the data alone reveals. For example, a company may employ an expert who is especially skilled at evaluating corporate culture, governance and management quality\u2014factors that are difficult to quantify but critical for long-term success. In investment decisions, human judgment can also help evaluate broader implications, such as how a potential investment aligns with your strategic goals and company values. By integrating AI\u2019s data-driven analysis with informed human insights, organizations can navigate complexities more effectively, which can, in turn, ensure that decisions are not only data-informed but also contextually relevant and aligned with broader market dynamics. Here are some best practices for effectively integrating AI insights with human expertise: Utilize AI to analyze datasets and generate actionable insights, then leverage human expertise to interpret these insights within a broader strategic framework. Your human experts should be able to provide context, evaluate patterns and foresee potential challenges to create a more comprehensive approach to decision-making that balances analytical rigor with strategic considerations. AI systems often carry biases from the historical data they are trained on, which can lead to skewed outcomes. Human experts play a major role in identifying and mitigating these biases. Best practices for bias mitigation include building diverse teams to review AI outputs, conducting regular bias assessments, and providing in-depth training to your employees on how to recognize and address these biases. AI can identify new opportunities by revealing inefficiencies or market gaps. Your human experts can add value by evaluating these opportunities within a broader industry and strategic context, thus aligning innovation with your business goals. Encourage cross-functional collaboration between AI engineers and industry experts to help ensure that new technological solutions are not only innovative but also practically applicable to the business environment. While AI excels in identifying risks based on historical patterns and statistical analysis, it lacks the ability to fully understand dynamic and emergent market conditions. Employ human experts who can provide insights on regulatory changes, geopolitical risks and other external factors. An integrated approach to risk management can allow you to create robust strategies to mitigate both known and emerging threats effectively. If your company currently lacks expertise in specific areas that you want to reinforce using AI, consider partnering with third-party information services and industry experts who have deep knowledge in your required fields. Their goal should be to ensure that your AI-driven decisions are grounded in the latest and most relevant human expertise. I believe the role of human expertise in decision-making will only grow in importance. By successfully combining AI\u2019s analytical capabilities with the contextual understanding and foresight of human experts, you can better equip your organization to navigate the complexities of the modern market.

    "full_text": "Mohan Kumar, an expert in Hyper-Scalable Temporal Data, drives innovation at AtoB; formerly of LinkedIn, Zenefits and D.E. Shaw.   Startups and growing companies often face the pivotal question, \"Should we build a solution in-house or buy it off the shelf?\" This decision significantly impacts resources, scalability and competitive positioning. Some companies thrive or fail based on this decision, making it one of the most critical challenges for leadership. The stakes are high: A wrong choice can lead to declining revenue, layoffs and lost market share. Conversely, the right choice can enable a company to outperform competitors, capture a larger total addressable market and solidify itself as an industry leader. While there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer, I\u2019ll explore the strategies, key considerations and common pitfalls that guide the build-vs-buy decision\u2014and whether there\u2019s a clear winner in this perennial debate. When deciding whether to build or buy, consider the following areas. Building a solution requires a significant upfront investment, including development, testing and future maintenance. Buying offers lower initial costs, but recurring subscription or licensing fees can add up. Additionally, consider how the solution impacts your unit economics\u2014will it provide value in both the near and long term? Building in-house demands specific skills and domain expertise. Ask whether your team has the necessary talent or if you'll need to recruit, which can be time-consuming and costly. On the other hand, buying also requires resources for integration. While there are rarely turnkey solutions, most require effort to customize and align with your existing systems. Time-to-market is one of the most critical factors in the build-vs-buy decision. Buying typically enables faster GTM, but it\u2019s important to think beyond the short term. While a purchased solution may get you to market quickly, it could prove inflexible or burdensome as you scale. Building, though slower initially, often delivers a solution tailored to your needs over the long haul. Regulatory requirements can heavily influence your decision. Companies in industries such as finance, healthcare or data privacy may find that many off-the-shelf solutions may fall short of compliance standards. If handling PII/PHI is central to your operations, building a solution may be the only viable option. Maintenance costs and effort must be factored into the equation. While a bought solution may appear more cost-effective upfront, expenses can rise as your business grows in complexity. Conversely, in-house solutions require dedicated resources for updates and troubleshooting. The key question is: Does your team have the expertise to maintain either option effectively? Building a solution can consume valuable time and resources that might be better spent on your core business objectives. At the same time, a bought solution may limit opportunities for customization or innovation. Weigh the trade-offs carefully\u2014does your choice unlock new possibilities or create constraints? Finally, ask yourself: Is this solution central to your company\u2019s unique value proposition? If it\u2019s core to your business strategy or offers a competitive edge, building is often the better option. For supporting functions, buying is usually more practical. Startups and growing companies often lean towards buying for speed, but this approach has its own risks. Avoid these common pitfalls. 1. Making A Decision Without Peer Input: Talk to companies in your industry who\u2019ve faced similar challenges. Ask how they navigated the build-vs-buy decision and what lessons they learned along the way. 2. Skipping Vendor References: Before committing to a vendor, request references and speak to their existing clients. Be candid in your questions about what works and what doesn\u2019t. Real-world feedback can reveal gaps that glossy sales materials won\u2019t show. 3. Neglecting Negotiation: Negotiation is about more than price\u2014it\u2019s also about defining your non-negotiables, such as service-level agreements, uptime guarantees or compliance standards. Build flexibility into your contract so it doesn\u2019t negatively affect your unit economics as you grow. 4. Failing To Reevaluate Vendors: Vendors constantly improve their offerings. What didn\u2019t work a year ago might now be more efficient or better suited to your needs. Periodically audit your existing integrations, and don\u2019t hesitate to explore alternative vendors to see if better options are available. 5. Assuming Products Are Static: Many vendors are open to customizing or building features for your use case. Don\u2019t assume that what you see in their demo is all you\u2019ll get. Approach vendors with your specific requirements\u2014they might surprise you with their willingness to collaborate. 6. Overlooking Future Scalability: While a solution might solve your immediate challenges, consider whether it will scale as your business grows. Evaluate the product\u2019s flexibility and identify potential bottlenecks that could arise as your operations expand. 7. Signing A Contract Without Testing The Product: Never commit to a solution without hands-on testing. Request a sandbox environment or a trial period to evaluate functionality, scalability and alignment with your needs. This will help you avoid costly surprises once the product is live. 8. Defaulting To The Popular Choice: The most popular product on the market may not be the best fit for your business. Take the time to research alternatives, even if they\u2019re less well-known, to ensure you\u2019re making the right choice for your unique needs. Sometimes, the best solution isn\u2019t purely build or buy\u2014it\u2019s a combination of both. Many companies begin with a pre-built solution to address immediate needs, saving time and resources upfront. As they grow and better understand their requirements, they transition to building an in-house system that integrates seamlessly with their unique workflows. This approach balances speed, scalability and customization, allowing businesses to adapt as their needs evolve. While there\u2019s no universal answer to the build-vs-buy dilemma, the key is making an informed choice that is aligned with your business goals, resources and strategy. Today\u2019s buy solutions are increasingly developer-friendly, prioritizing privacy and compliance, making them attractive for growth-stage companies. Many businesses start with buying for speed and convenience, pivoting to building as their needs evolve. Whether you build, buy or adopt a hybrid approach, the goal is to drive growth, enhance flexibility and set your company up for long-term success.

Three years from today all obligations of the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) will be fully applicable, with vulnerability reporting obligations applying already from September 2026. By that time, the CRA\u2014from idea to implementation\u2014will have been high on GitHub\u2019s developer policy agenda for nearly six years. Together with our partners, GitHub has engaged with EU lawmakers to ensure that the CRA avoids unintended consequences for the open source ecosystem, which forms the backbone of any modern software stack. This joint effort has paid off: while the first draft of the CRA created significant legal uncertainty for open source projects, the end result allocates responsibility for cybersecurity more clearly with those entities that have the resources to act. As an open source developer, you\u2019re too busy to become a policy wonk in your spare time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to understand the origins and purpose of the CRA and to help you assess whether the CRA applies to you and your project. The reasons why the EU decided to start regulating software products are clear: cheap IoT devices that end up being abused in botnets, smartphones that fail to receive security updates just a couple of years after purchase, apps that accidentally leak user data, and more. These are not just a nuisance for the consumers directly affected by them, they can be a starting point for cyberattacks that weaken entire industries and disrupt public services. To address this problem, the CRA creates cybersecurity, maintenance, and vulnerability disclosure requirements for software products on the EU market. Cybersecurity is just as important for open source as it is for any other software. At the same time, open source has flourished precisely because it has always been offered as-is, free to re-use by anyone, but without any guarantees offered by the community that developed it. Despite their great value to society, open source projects are frequently understaffed and underresourced. That\u2019s why GitHub has been advocating for a stronger focus on supporting, rather than regulating, open source projects. For example, GitHub supports upscaling public funding programs like Germany\u2019s Sovereign Tech Agency, who is joining us for a GitTogether today to discuss open source sustainability. This approach has also informed the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund, which will help projects improve their cybersecurity posture through funding, education, and free tools. Applications are open until January 7. The CRA creates obligations for software manufacturers, importers, and distributors. If you contribute to open source in a personal capacity, the most important question will be whether the CRA applies to you at all. In many cases, the answer will be \u201cno,\u201d but some uncertainty remains because the EU is still in the process of developing follow-up legislation and guidance on how the law should be applied. As with any law, courts will have the final word on how the CRA is to be interpreted. From its inception, the CRA sought to exclude any free and open source software that falls outside of a commercial activity. To protect the open source ecosystem, GitHub has fought for a clear definition of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d throughout the legislative process. In the end, the EU legislature has added clarifying language that should help place the principal burden of compliance on companies that benefit from open source, not on the open source projects they are relying on. In determining whether the CRA applies to your open source project, the key will be whether the open source software is \u201cma[de] available on the market,\u201d that is, intended for \u201cdistribution or use in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge.\u201d (Art. 3(22); *see also *Art. 3(1), (22), (48); Recitals 18-19). Generally, as long as it\u2019s not, then the CRA\u2019s provisions won\u2019t apply at all. If you intend to monetize the open source software yourself, then you are likely a manufacturer under the CRA, and subject to its full requirements (Art. 3(13)). If you are part of an organization that supports and maintains open source software that is intended for commercial use by others, that organization may be classified as an \u201copen source software steward\u201d under the CRA (Art. 3(14), Recital 19). Following conversations with the open source community, EU lawmakers introduced this new category to better reflect the diverse landscape of actors that take responsibility for open source. Examples of stewards include \u201ccertain foundations as well as entities that develop and publish free and open-source software in a business context, including not-for-profit entities\u201d (Recital 19). Stewards have limited obligations under the CRA: they have to put in place and document a cybersecurity policy, notify cybersecurity authorities of actively exploited vulnerabilities in their projects that they become aware of, and promote sharing of information on discovered vulnerabilities with the open source community (Art. 24). The details of these obligations will be fleshed out by industry standards over the next few years, but the CRA\u2019s text makes clear a key distinction\u2014that open source stewards should be subjected to a \u201clight-touch . . . regulatory regime\u201d (Recital 19). Developers should be mindful of some key provisions as they decipher whether they will be deemed manufacturers, stewards, or wholly unaffected by the CRA: Even with the clarifications added during the legislative process, many open source developers still struggle to make sense of whether they\u2019re covered or not. If you think your open source activities may fall within the scope of the CRA (either as a manufacturer or as a steward), the Eclipse ORC Working Group is a good place to get connected with other open source organizations that are thinking about the CRA and related standardization activities. Linux Foundation is currently co-hosting a workshop for open source stewards and manufacturers to prepare for compliance with OpenSSF, who is publishing resources about the CRA. While it\u2019s good news that some classes of open source developers will face minimal obligations, that probably won\u2019t stop some companies from contacting projects about their CRA compliance. In the best case, this will lead to constructive conversations with companies taking responsibility for improving the cybersecurity of open source projects they depend upon. The CRA offers opportunities for that: for example, it allows manufacturers to finance a voluntary security attestation of open source software (Art. 25), and it requires manufacturers who have developed a fix for a vulnerability in an open source component to contribute that fix back to the project (Art. 13(6)). In the worst case, companies working on their own CRA compliance will send requests phrased as demands to overworked open source maintainers who will spend hours talking to lawyers just to often find out that they are not legally required to help manufacturers. To avoid the worst-case scenario and help realize the opportunities of the CRA for open source projects, GitHub\u2019s developer policy team is engaging with the cybersecurity agencies and regulators, such as the European Commission, that are creating guidance on how the rules will work in practice. Most urgently, we call on the European Commission to issue guidance (required under Art. 26 (2) (a)) that will make it easy for every open source developer to determine whether they face obligations under the CRA or not. We are also giving input to related legislation, such as the NIS2 Directive, which defines supply chain security rules for certain critical services. Our north star is advocating for rules that support open source projects rather than unduly burden them. We are convinced that this approach will lead to better security outcomes for everyone and a more sustainable open source ecosystem. \n@felixreda\n Felix Reda (he/they) is the Director of Developer Policy at GitHub.

    "full_text": "By Nick Botha, Global Payments Lead, AutoRek  From artificial intelligence (AI) to blockchain, the rapid evolution of fintech has raised\r\nquestions about balancing innovation and guardrails. According to a study by\r\nthe MIT Sloan School of Management, policymakers are struggling to establish governance\r\nframeworks while supporting digital transformation.  As financial operations increasingly embrace automation\r\nand digitization, the key question\r\nis: Can U.S. firms adopt a growth mindset to cut legacy methods and reimagine\r\nmiddle and back-office cultures to integrate cutting-edge technologies? The\r\nanswer may determine their ability to not only adapt but also deliver enhanced\r\nvalue to the market. Real-time payments will redefine reconciliation standards The manual,\r\nend-of-day batch jobs and spreadsheet-driven audits that have long been staples\r\nof back-office operations simply won't cut it in an always-on payment\r\nlandscape. The ripple effects of real-time payments (RTP) go beyond faster\r\ntransfers. They are setting a new gold standard for visibility and\r\naccountability in financial operations. Customers and regulators alike are\r\ndemanding transparency, and the inability to reconcile in real-time risks\r\ndamaging trust and incurring compliance penalties. Instantaneous\r\npayment confirmations and enriched data flows are rewriting reconciliation as a\r\nproactive, real-time function rather than a reactive cleanup job. This calls\r\nfor tech-driven solutions and smarter workflows to keep up with the blistering\r\npace of transactions. Compliance\r\ndemands drive the rise of automation  Regulatory\r\npressures aren't just tightening the screws-they're turbocharging the case for\r\ncompliance automation. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expanding its budget and workforce to\r\nunprecedented levels. As global authorities enforce increasingly complex\r\nmandates, businesses are drowning in a sea of audits, filings and reporting\r\nrequirements. The old-school, manual approach to compliance is officially\r\nobsolete.  Regulators are increasingly favoring firms\r\nthat adopt advanced technology, recognizing that automated processes provide a level of traceability\r\nand precision unattainable with manual methods. As the digital economy grows,\r\ntransaction volumes surge and regulatory demands evolve, sticking to outdated\r\nmethods for critical processes becomes an inefficient and costly approach.  In this high-stakes landscape, automation isn't a\r\nluxury-it's an essential component of doing business today. By automating tasks like validations and\r\ncash transfers, firms can achieve greater speed and precision in handling\r\ndata-related processes. This also frees resources to focus on activities that\r\nbenefit from human expertise and creative problem-solving. Compliance teams can play \"offense\" by deploying\r\nartificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to flag potential risks\r\nbefore they spiral into costly penalties. Many organizations face challenges with data interoperability,\r\ninfrastructure constraints and fully leveraging available data. AI can simplify\r\nthe reconciliation process by extracting key data fields, minimizing\r\ncomplexity, and lowering operational costs. Global expansion of fintech solutions will reshape U.S. data\r\ncontrols As FinTech's scale across borders, the influx of\r\ninternational data flows is testing the limits of U.S. regulations designed for\r\na pre-globalized, siloed world. Emerging players from Asia, Europe, and beyond\r\nare introducing cutting-edge solutions and cross-border partnerships that\r\nchallenge the way U.S. firms handle privacy, security, and compliance. The\r\nresult? A seismic shift in how data is governed, with U.S. businesses and\r\nregulators scrambling to keep up with the pace of global innovation. In this new world order, data localization debates,\r\ninteroperability standards, and privacy laws aren't theoretical-they're battle\r\nlines in a high-stakes game for competitive advantage. The global fintech boom\r\nis reshaping consumer expectations, demanding instant, secure, and seamless\r\nfinancial experiences regardless of borders.  U.S. companies that cling to outdated, rigid data\r\ncontrols risk alienating customers and losing ground to more agile competitors.\r\nAdaptation is the price of admission, and those unwilling to evolve will find\r\nthemselves edged out in a market that thrives on bold, borderless innovation.  Embracing a new\r\nera The financial\r\nsector is at a pivotal crossroads, where innovation, regulation and\r\nglobalization are converging to reshape the industry's landscape. From\r\nreal-time payments revolutionizing reconciliation to compliance automation\r\nemerging as a competitive necessity, the industry is shedding outdated\r\nframeworks and embracing a future fueled by technology. However, with\r\nopportunity comes urgency-companies that fail to keep up with the growing\r\ndemands for real-time operations, regulatory compliance, and global fintech\r\nexpansion risk being left behind. This is not a time for indecision; it's a\r\ncall for swift action and strategic investments in the tools and approaches\r\nthat will define the next decade of finance.  ##  ABOUT THE AUTHOR Nick Botha \u2013 Global Payments Sales and Relationship Manager  \u00a0 As the Senior sales representative for Payments firms at AutoRek, Nick is responsible for managing client relationships within these sectors and engaging with stakeholders to ensure AutoRek\u2019s product offering is in line with the market demands.

It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Once officially licensed Bitpanda will be able to commence operations in the UAE as Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, marking its official entry into markets beyond Europe and solidifying its position as a trusted, global player in the digital assets space.With the UAE emerging as a premier hub for digital finance and cryptocurrency trading, Bitpanda\u2019s in-principle approval by VARA underscores its ambition to lead the global adoption of regulated virtual assets. The expansion follows a series of strategic moves, including the establishment of its Dubai office at the DMCC Crypto Centre earlier this year, onboarding a team of regional experts, and forming key partnerships with financial institutions and crypto platforms in the region.Eric Demuth, Co-Founder and CEO of Bitpanda, commented: \u201cIn Europe, we have built a reputation as the most trusted and regulated digital asset platform. Now, we are scaling this proven model globally, with Dubai and the UAE serving as our strategic launchpad for international expansion. The opportunities are immense, and we are uniquely positioned to seize them - both as Europe\u2019s leading crypto broker and as a top infrastructure provider in the digital assets space.\u201dThe UAE\u2019s forward-thinking regulatory framework and status as a global digital asset hub make it the ideal choice for Bitpanda\u2019s first step outside of Europe. VARA\u2019s robust regulatory guidelines foster innovation while prioritizing investor protection\u2014core principles that align seamlessly with Bitpanda\u2019s mission to offer secure and accessible digital asset solutions worldwide.Fabian Reinisch, General Counsel of Bitpanda, added: \u201cSecuring VARA\u2019s in-principle approval in under eight months reflects the strength of VARA\u2019s progressive regulatory framework and Bitpanda\u2019s steadfast commitment to compliance and innovation. For over a decade, we have demonstrated that a compliance-first approach is the only path to sustainable and responsible growth in our industry. Now, we are extending this approach to markets beyond Europe.\u201dBitpanda\u2019s expansion reinforces the company\u2019s commitment to operating in accordance with the highest regulatory standards, while actively supporting the global adoption of digital assets. With its track record as Europe\u2019s most regulated crypto platform and rigorous focus on meeting and exceeding regulatory requirements, Bitpanda is well positioned to deliver a secure and seamless experience to investors across the UAE and, ultimately, the wider region.

    "full_text": "Einaras von Gravrock is CEO of CUBE3.AI, a pre-crime crypto fraud prevention platform that stops scams before they happen.   Blockchain technology is revolutionizing businesses with its promise of transparency, efficiency and security. Yet, the same features that make it appealing also create opportunities for fraud. Industry reports show around 40% of scams \"touch\" crypto, and my company has found a similar number to be true for those exploiting blockchain technology. With fraud evolving faster than ever, businesses must prioritize security to protect their operations and maintain trust. Whether used for payments, employee records or smart contracts, blockchain applications require robust fraud prevention to succeed in an increasingly regulated and interconnected world. Fraud in blockchain applications is growing, often adapting familiar methods like phishing or social engineering to exploit the technology\u2019s unique features. Here\u2019s how these schemes often unfold: \u2022 Entry point: Attackers gain access through phishing emails, fake invoices or impersonated partners. A business might unknowingly process a fraudulent transaction or onboard a malicious actor. \u2022 The transition: Once inside, fraudsters manipulate blockchain records, introduce malicious smart contracts or exploit security gaps. Because blockchain processes are automated and immutable, these actions often go undetected. \u2022 The endpoint: The scheme concludes with financial loss, unauthorized data access or manipulated records. The decentralized nature of blockchain often makes reversing these actions extremely challenging. As businesses adopt blockchain for sensitive applications like payments and employee records, they must recognize the risks and take proactive measures to address vulnerabilities. Trust is the backbone of blockchain\u2019s promise. To harness its full potential, businesses need to ensure their systems are secure and resilient against fraud. At the same time, the regulatory landscape is changing to keep pace with blockchain\u2019s rapid adoption. While regulations vary globally, the focus remains on ensuring user protections and fostering transparency. Businesses that proactively strengthen their security practices and align with industry standards can mitigate fraud risks and build trust with stakeholders and customers alike. The financial sector has spent decades refining fraud prevention systems, and these lessons are highly applicable to blockchain: \u2022 Continuous monitoring: Just as banks monitor transactions for suspicious activity, blockchain users should keep a close eye on workflows, smart contracts and data entries to detect irregularities. \u2022 Proactive alerts: Timely notifications about unusual activity allow teams to respond quickly, minimizing potential damage. \u2022 Collaboration: Traditional financial institutions often share insights to combat fraud collectively. I suggest blockchain businesses adopt a similar approach, working with industry peers and regulators to strengthen defenses. These strategies highlight how lessons from traditional finance can strengthen trust and security in blockchain applications. Businesses can take several steps to secure their blockchain applications against fraud, such as monitoring activity in real time with tools to track blockchain processes, flagging anomalies in workflows or smart contracts as they happen. (Disclosure: My company provides solutions for this, as do others.) Staying fully informed about risks across all facets of your blockchain operations is key to effective fraud prevention. This involves not just monitoring your own assets\u2014such as wallets and smart contracts\u2014but also understanding the risk profiles of external stakeholders, including business partners and service providers. A thorough awareness of potential risks ensures a stronger security posture. Best practices for achieving this include: \u2022 Balancing pre-crime and post-crime measures: Traditional post-crime tools are critical for investigating incidents and addressing fraud after it occurs. However, they can be complemented by predictive tools that assess risks, flag potential threats and guide preventative actions before fraud materializes. This proactive layer minimizes risks and reinforces trust. \u2022 Tailored risk thresholds: Not all businesses face the same threats. Tailoring monitoring thresholds to reflect specific operational risks and customer expectations allows organizations to act decisively\u2014whether that\u2019s by alerting users, blocking fraudulent actions or escalating issues. \u2022 Addressing distinct needs: Compliance monitoring, while focused on regulatory adherence, differs from fraud prevention, which aims to detect and mitigate threats. Businesses should ensure their monitoring strategies address both objectives where relevant, without diluting the specific focus of fraud prevention tools. Additional steps companies can take include: \u2022 Strengthening authentication and access: Multi-factor authentication and strict access controls can help you protect sensitive systems. \u2022 Testing smart contracts thoroughly: Regularly audit smart contracts to ensure they are secure and function as intended. \u2022 Educating employees: Equip teams with the knowledge to recognize phishing attempts, social engineering and other fraud tactics. \u2022 Collaborating across the industry: Share insights through industry forums and initiatives to strengthen collective security. Blockchain is a powerful tool for innovation, but its success hinges on trust. By addressing fraud risks head-on, aligning with emerging regulations and fostering collaboration, businesses can unlock its full potential while safeguarding their operations. From payments to employee records, ensuring security and transparency across applications will shape the future of blockchain. Trust is the key to success\u2014and in today\u2019s world, trust is everything. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

    "full_text": "Chris McHenry is Vice President of Product Management at Aviatrix.   Enterprise reliance on cloud computing is no longer a question of \"if\" but \"how much\u201d and \u201chow secure.\" The cloud has become the backbone of modern business, enabling rapid scaling, seamless integration and global reach. However, as cloud adoption matures, so do its associated costs\u2014driven significantly by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the escalating energy demands of data centers. For instance, OpenAI recently revealed plans to increase its prices by 120% over the next five years, even after securing an industry-record $6.6 billion in funding. This underscores the financial pressures that any company using AI is under to accommodate intensive workloads. As more enterprises adopt AI-driven technologies, these cost pressures will only intensify, leading companies to rethink their cloud strategies and seek greater flexibility in both cloud services and deployment models. One of the primary reasons cloud costs are spiraling is the sheer computing power required for AI workloads. AI-driven applications\u2014from machine learning models to large-scale data analytics\u2014consume vast amounts of processing power. This isn\u2019t just a trend for tech startups or research institutions anymore; industries across the board, from healthcare to finance, are leaning heavily into AI for competitive advantage. Microsoft\u2019s 20-year deal to purchase all power from the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor illustrates the lengths companies must go to meet their power needs. To put AI\u2019s power in perspective, Unit 1 can generate enough electricity for over 800,000 homes. Beyond AI, data center operators are grappling with rising costs related to cooling, hardware upgrades and scaling infrastructure. The energy required to keep up with this demand\u2014combined with a push for greener, more sustainable practices\u2014further inflates operational costs. As enterprises, particularly those working with AI, rely more on the cloud, the direct correlation between increased workloads and escalating expenses becomes evident. Enterprises have dedicated significant resources over the years to optimizing their computing and storage capabilities to reduce costs. Now, they must shift their focus toward optimizing networking and security as well. However, many cloud service providers (CSPs) lack the robust features necessary for secure cloud egress, multicloud environments and the movement of data between various sites and co-locations. As organizations adopt multicloud networking (MCN) strategies, they're also looking for robust security measures that can effectively protect their data across different platforms. Based on our experience at Aviatrix, these areas typically account for 15% to 20% of an enterprise\u2019s total cloud spending, underscoring their importance and the potential savings from optimization as part of an MCN strategy, which involves distributing infrastructure and data across multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Google, Azure, Oracle and Alibaba. This approach enhances business continuity and resilience by allowing organizations to leverage a mix of providers instead of being locked into a single vendor. A nimble MCN strategy built around the philosophy of \u201ccloud independence\u201d gives enterprises greater workload flexibility and more opportunities for savings, including bargaining power. It allows companies to design their network architecture to maximize flexibility and portability\u2014for example, by supporting the ideal location for an application that requires ultra-low-latency connections to the cloud. But navigating the cost strategy of MCN can be complicated. Enterprises are increasingly faced with a trend of cloud providers passing along their soaring overhead costs. Mergers and acquisitions in the market are also driving up prices, such as Broadcom\u2019s acquisition of VMware and Google's purchasing of Mandiant. Managing the billing from multiple providers can be complex. Non-transparent pricing can make it difficult to estimate or account for usage costs that need to be reconciled against multiple providers. Security and scalability considerations\u2014in addition to compliance requirements like HIPPA and GDPR\u2014also come into play. When considering cloud infrastructure, it\u2019s essential not to simply follow the recommendations of cloud providers, as these can often lead to vendor lock-in. Instead, organizations should seek an MCN provider that helps maintain control over their investments. One significant concern is the steep egress charges imposed by many providers, which can penalize customers for moving data. To mitigate these costs, focus on a network architecture that facilitates easy data movement without triggering additional fees. Look for billing models that are transparent, straightforward and predictable\u2014ideally, consider an \"all you can eat\" pricing model. Additionally, choose solutions that can scale more effectively than native cloud network address translation (NAT), which is often difficult to upgrade and typically only provides inbound security, lacking outbound protections. Your strategy shouldn't require a trade-off between high performance and robust security, as many CSP solutions only excel in one area at the expense of the other. Firewalls are another critical component of a cloud independence strategy. Seek solutions that seamlessly integrate with existing cloud traffic flows and don't necessitate significant changes to your network architecture. Firewall options that employ a distributed enforcement model can help reduce data transfer costs and eliminate bottlenecks. Finally, ensure that your cloud independence strategy supports hybrid environments. There may be times when it's beneficial or necessary\u2014due to business or regulatory reasons\u2014to move workloads back on premises. Given the unpredictability of such situations, it\u2019s vital to build flexibility into your strategy. This adaptability will be crucial as regulatory and business needs continue to evolve. The cost of cloud infrastructure will continue to rise, driven by AI adoption and the growing power needs of data centers. But with a strategic approach that prioritizes flexibility in deployment and cloud provider choice, enterprises can navigate these challenges and achieve freedom of choice without incurring steep costs, helping ensure both efficiency and security in their operations.

The Global Impact Leaders (GIL) are a diverse and inclusive network of impact practitioners and thought leaders working toward positive social and environmental impact around the world. They represent a range of sectors \u2014 including impact finance and banking, media, technology, and more. While their experiences and viewpoints vary, they share a common goal of working toward positive social and environmental impact. As the end of 2024 approaches and global election results are confirmed, information from the GIL survey can help guide investors and partners as they consider the role of policy and advocacy in their work. With more than $1.5 trillion invested in social and environmental impact, the community has a growing reach. Similarly, leadership changes in the U.S. and elsewhere have implications for their work to shape a more inclusive and equitable economy. One overarching GIL survey takeaway points to the importance of policy for social and environmental impact initiatives: A large majority of respondents indicated that governments have the most responsibility for implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which represent the world\u2019s biggest social and environmental challenges. With this in mind, 51% of respondents say they want to see more impactful efforts in policy and lobbying efforts in the field. As investing for positive impact and financial returns gains traction, the community\u2019s public voice can grow stronger. This provides the impact investing community with a greater opportunity to speak up in the public sector for policy frameworks that can amplify their work to drive long-term solutions in areas such as affordable housing, access to healthcare, and regenerative agriculture. Here, we share survey results and comments from impact leaders to examine how investors and others in the impact community can take aligned action for policies that help shape sustainable markets and encourage innovation. The vast majority of survey responses indicated that elections in the United States and across Europe and India were the most likely to influence the field's work. Free press, climate denial, and changes to regulatory bodies were mentioned as primary concerns related to those election outcomes. Responses saying that the outcome of the U.S. election wouldn't significantly affect their strategies or decision-making were consistent with the belief that impact investing is not limited to the U.S. political landscape. While respondents acknowledged that administrations could increase or decrease hurdles, most expressed that those would not be significant enough to warrant changes in strategy. As Jacques-Philippe Piverger, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of GoodLight Capital, said: \u201cGenerally speaking, I don't anticipate the presidential election having a material impact on my decision-making. I think for those looking for an excuse not to participate, certain policies can significantly affect their activities.\u201d Those who acknowledge the influence of U.S. politics on the field said they have confidence in the purpose of the work driving progress. \u201cI think approaches might be different, but I\u2019ve found that the political center can come together around good policy that utilizes principles of free enterprise and capitalism to address social problems and benefit society,\u201d said Jim Sorenson, Founder of Sorenson Impact Group. That includes efforts to address income disparities through policy that supports initiatives like affordable housing and employee ownership, Sorenson said. \u201cThere are a few areas in policy that could make a massive difference in economic mobility in our society by helping to enable passive wealth-building opportunities for those left behind through investing in scalable market-based solutions for home affordability and homeownership, as well as ownership in the company you work for or participation in a managed 401(k) plan,\u201d Sorenson said. The impact sector can tap into its strengths \u2014 creativity, connection, and long-term benefit \u2014 to amplify the combined efforts of public and private entities. Nancy Pfund, Founder & Managing Partner of DBL Partners, said that proactive collaboration with policymakers can accelerate progress on innovative solutions. \u201cWe must go beyond reacting to regulations and actively engage with policymakers and regulators early and often,\u201d she said. \u201cBy sharing on-the-ground insights from portfolio companies and presenting real-world use cases, we can help shape policy and regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation rather than stifle it.\u201d The GIL survey also suggested that tax breaks, grants, and other incentives should better reflect the challenges faced by the private sector and that governments should work more closely with private companies to create effective incentives. Some referenced \u201cproviding carrots and sticks\u201d for successful government involvement in achieving impact goals, marking incentives and regulations together as the solution. Building connections among stakeholders is vital for the private sector to educate and guide the public sector in the creation of incentives and regulations, as the public sector is not always aware of emerging technologies or innovations. \"It is incumbent upon private entities to engage with policymakers to share what solutions are being developed, where roadblocks are being encountered, and what support would make a difference,\u201d Pfund said. Public-private partnerships have the potential to accelerate the adoption of impactful solutions to challenges in sectors including regenerative agriculture, clean energy, transportation, and housing. \u201cBy demonstrating successful models of cooperation, we can help create a blueprint for how governments can support and help to broadly disseminate the innovations that will drive climate and societal progress,\u201d Pfund said. She added that the impact investing community can amplify its influence by forming coalitions that include not just investors and entrepreneurs, but also NGOs, think tanks, and advocacy groups. \u201cBy presenting a united front, we can bring greater visibility to key issues and create a stronger, more coordinated push for policy reforms that support the creation and deployment of technologies that solve our biggest climate and social challenges,\u201d Pfund said. Amid recent rhetoric around ESG efforts and regulations, a 69% majority of survey respondents said that the increasingly widespread adoption of ESG by investors is broadly positive for the impact field. Karen E. Wilson, Founder and CEO of GV Partners and Affiliate Faculty at London Business School, said the growing ESG reporting requirements present an opportunity to move from compliance to establishing proper governance to help ensure corporations embed impact strategy throughout their organizations. \u201cMore training is needed for board members and senior executives to get them up to speed. The responsibility should not rest with one appointed sustainability/ESG/impact person on a board but should be embedded into the role of all.\u201d Going beyond reporting regulations to infuse impact and sustainability strategy throughout an organization can encourage more people to see the tie between ESG factors and long-term enterprise value, Wilson said. \u201cWhile increased reporting requirements are helpful in terms of improving transparency, it has created a backlash due to the time, costs, and confusion generated. More critically, this has led to shifting mindsets to think that sustainability and impact is a reporting/compliance exercise instead of being strategic,\u201d she said. \u201cI have seen this mindset shift in the more recent cohorts of executives I teach. We therefore need to reinforce the message that impact is strategic and, in many cases, financially material to businesses. Leaders need to be more aware that they are making choices every day in terms of how much they consider their organization\u2019s positive and negative impacts in their decision-making and those choices will have longer-term implications.\u201d Governments can also play a role in new models that align public and private goals with business innovation, including investing public money into early-stage technology or other new avenues. That partnership mindset can help impact investors, government, and other sectors to advance needed changes, said Chintan Panchal, Founding Partner of RPCK. \u201cHistorically, investing has had an extractive dimension to it. Whether it be in commercial lending or venture capital or private equity, the competitive, zero-sum, short-term, and extractive dimensions of investing have led to significant negative externalities and societal-scale challenges,\u201d Panchal said. \u201cImpact investors have an opportunity to prove the thesis that a partnering, trust-reinforcing, value-creating mindset has the ability to generate long-term, stable and successful outcomes. Thus, simply adopting the tools of the more extractive investing sectors can exacerbate existing challenges and paradigms.\u201d Advocacy for the creation of a global legal structure to track progress within the field can help entrepreneurs and investors focus on change-making work rather than bureaucratic processes, said Cliff Prior of GSG Impact. \u201cWe are now surrounded by regulatory reporting requirements, corporate disclosures, impact measurement and management systems, sustainability standards, impact transparency measures, and more,\u201d Prior said. \u201cSome of these are valuable, but a fair few simply overlap, and some countries take different approaches. Some developed countries are putting significant regulatory reporting burdens on SME companies in low- and middle-income countries, causing unintentional harm. We need to see harmonized systems for each area of activity.\u201d Read the full survey report for additional insights from Global Impact Leaders.  One Community.

    "full_text": "Tamas Kadar is the CEO and cofounder of SEON.   As fraud schemes grow more sophisticated and AI-powered threats proliferate, organizations must modernize their fraud prevention strategies to keep pace. Traditional one-size-fits-all approaches are no longer effective in countering the nuanced, industry-specific tactics of bad actors. Transitioning to modern fraud protection requires not just advanced technologies but also rethinking internal processes, fostering collaboration and addressing potential challenges. Adopting industry-specific fraud prevention strategies helps companies mitigate risks and stay ahead of emerging threats. Tailored rule sets, industry-specific machine learning algorithms and preconfigured scoring systems offer a powerful first line of defense, driving more effective anti-fraud measures from the outset. By aligning prevention tactics with industry-specific challenges, organizations protect their assets, foster customer trust and promote long-term growth by understanding threats targeting their unique sectors. A brief look at the top challenges several industries are experiencing showcases the span and scope of fraudulent attack vectors and the different priorities. Many fraudsters aim to exploit the high-volume, fast-paced nature of online betting and casino platforms. Bonus abuse is a primary concern, with bad actors creating multiple accounts to capitalize on welcome offers and promotions. Additionally, multi-accounting and bot-driven activities pose significant threats by potentially manipulating game outcomes and draining promotional funds. Money laundering attempts through strategic betting and quick cash-outs further challenge operators striving to maintain regulatory compliance and platform integrity. Chargeback fraud is a chief fraud vector in the payments industry. This occurs when consumers dispute legitimate charges, either maliciously or due to genuine confusion, resulting in financial losses and operational headaches. Card-not-present (CNP) fraud remains a persistent issue as well. Meanwhile, financial services institutions face the growing threat of synthetic identity fraud, where criminals combine real and fabricated personal information to create new identities for fraudulent accounts and transactions. Fintech companies operating at the intersection of finance and technology face unique challenges. Account takeover (ATO) attempts are particularly prevalent in this sector, with fraudsters leveraging sophisticated techniques like credential stuffing and phishing to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. The consequences of successful ATOs can be severe, potentially compromising sensitive financial data and funds. Moreover, the rapid innovation in fintechs can create new vulnerabilities that fraudsters quickly exploit. Both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce businesses contend with evolving fraud tactics in the retail sector. Return fraud remains a significant issue, with malicious actors exploiting lenient policies through tactics like wardrobing (wearing and returning items) and receipt fraud. Online retailers face additional challenges, including promo abuse, refund fraud and gift card fraud, where individuals exploit digital loopholes for financial gain. The rise of omnichannel retail has also created new opportunities for fraudsters to exploit gaps between online and offline systems, making it crucial for businesses to adopt comprehensive fraud prevention strategies. The journey toward modernization begins with a thorough evaluation of current tools and processes. Many organizations rely on legacy systems that lack the flexibility to adapt to today's rapidly changing fraud tactics. Conducting a comprehensive audit to identify gaps and vulnerabilities is essential. This assessment should involve teams across departments\u2014fraud prevention specialists, IT, compliance and customer service\u2014to ensure a holistic understanding of exposure points. Benchmarking against industry standards can provide valuable insights into where improvements are needed. Resistance to change is a common hurdle, particularly among employees accustomed to existing workflows. To overcome this, organizations must communicate the measurable benefits of modernization. Fraud prevention cannot operate in a silo; it requires alignment across departments. Establishing regular communication and collaboration ensures strategies are integrated into broader business objectives. For example, involving fraud prevention teams early in product development can preempt vulnerabilities while balancing security with user experience. Organizations should also implement regular training and awareness programs to educate employees on emerging fraud trends and detection techniques. This not only strengthens internal defenses but also promotes a unified approach to combating fraud. Modern fraud prevention relies heavily on advanced technologies such as AI and real-time monitoring systems. These tools analyze vast datasets to detect anomalies and subtle patterns that traditional methods often miss. Incorporating device intelligence and behavioral analytics enhances detection capabilities by tracking digital footprints and monitoring unusual user behavior. Seamlessly integrating these technologies into existing workflows is critical to minimizing disruption. Modern solutions can not only reduce fraud losses but also enhance the customer experience by minimizing friction and false positives. Deploying new solutions is most effective when approached incrementally. A phased implementation allows organizations to pilot-test solutions, refine processes and address challenges before scaling up. Continuous monitoring and iterative refinement are key to long-term success. Fraud detection models and rules must evolve alongside emerging threats. By creating feedback loops, organizations can ensure their systems remain adaptable and effective over time. A structured approach to deployment reduces the risk of operational disruptions and builds confidence among employees and stakeholders. Historically, fraud detection systems often operated as black boxes, offering little insight into their decision-making processes. This lack of clarity can lead to inefficiencies and erode trust among stakeholders. Adopting white-box AI models can provide clear explanations for flagged transactions, improving trust and enabling organizations to address false positives effectively. Adaptability is equally critical. Fraud tactics evolve rapidly, often outpacing static defenses. Real-time monitoring and dynamic risk scoring can allow organizations to evaluate and adjust to new patterns continuously. By leveraging contextual data such as device intelligence and digital footprints, organizations can implement more precise fraud detection measures that target their specific business needs while preserving the user experience. The future of fraud prevention will likely see increased collaboration, with machine learning facilitating fraud intelligence sharing while maintaining data privacy. By evaluating current capabilities, fostering cross-functional alignment, leveraging advanced technologies and navigating compliance challenges, organizations can create a more resilient fraud prevention framework. This modernization not only protects against emerging threats but also builds a foundation for sustained growth and customer trust.

    "full_text": "Chipmaker NVIDIA's Valuation Passes 1 Trillion In Market Cap Nvidia has redefined the AI chip industry, becoming synonymous with high-performance computing for artificial intelligence. Its GPUs power breakthroughs across sectors from healthcare to finance, elevating the company to the world's most valuable by market capitalization in 2025. However, recent challenges, including a stock price decline due to a Chinese antitrust investigation, are testing its dominance. On December 9, 2024, China's State Administration for Market Regulation initiated an antitrust investigation into Nvidia's compliance with laws related to its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. Mellanox, with significant operations in China, was a critical addition to Nvidia\u2019s portfolio, providing networking solutions for data centers. The investigation has unsettled investors, contributing to a 2.7% drop in Nvidia\u2019s stock price, which was already under pressure from broader market volatility. This scrutiny comes amid intensifying competition in the AI hardware sector. Companies like AMD, under CEO Lisa Su's leadership, have significantly increased their market share in data centers and AI applications. Additionally, tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are developing proprietary AI chips, aiming to reduce reliance on Nvidia's GPUs. These developments suggest that while Nvidia has been instrumental in advancing AI hardware, its position is increasingly challenged by both regulatory pressures and emerging competitors. As artificial intelligence grew in complexity, it demanded equally advanced hardware to support it. Nvidia capitalized on this need, leveraging its GPUs to become the backbone of AI infrastructure. Its meteoric rise has been bolstered by a strategic focus on innovation and vertical integration, but recent headwinds may signal a potential turning point. Despite these recent anti-trust challenges, Nvidia\u2019s ascent is a case study in long-term vision, strategic investment, and relentless execution. Nvidia\u2019s dominance stems from decades of strategic investment, including billions poured into the CUDA ecosystem, developer education, and community-building around AI. This approach laid the foundation for an ecosystem that developers trust and rely on. Nvidia\u2019s early recognition of GPUs\u2019 potential for AI workloads was transformative. Unlike CPUs, which process tasks sequentially, GPUs excel at parallel processing\u2014critical for training and running AI models. This insight gave Nvidia a crucial first-mover advantage. The CUDA platform turned Nvidia hardware into a unified ecosystem. By establishing CUDA as the industry standard for AI development, Nvidia created significant switching costs for companies considering alternative hardware. From the Tesla GPU series to the groundbreaking Hopper architecture, Nvidia has consistently pushed the limits of performance, energy efficiency, and specialized AI capabilities like Tensor Cores. Nvidia\u2019s foresight in aligning its R&D investments with AI\u2019s trajectory, coupled with partnerships with cloud providers, electric power companies, universities, and enterprises, solidified its status as the go-to provider for AI infrastructure. Through software frameworks like cuDNN and TensorRT and platforms like DGX systems, Nvidia has created a vertically integrated ecosystem. This one-stop-shop approach eliminates the need for fragmented solutions, further strengthening its market position. Nvidia\u2019s dominance is a testament to strategic vision and innovation, but the competitive landscape is evolving. A mix of established players, tech giants with custom silicon, and innovative startups is intensifying the AI chip race. While Nvidia\u2019s leadership position remains strong, several factors could reshape the competitive dynamics: The rise of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits for specialized workloads poses a direct challenge to GPUs. Companies like Google and Amazon, with their in-house chips, could erode Nvidia\u2019s market share. Nvidia\u2019s reliance on TSMC for manufacturing makes it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Competitors with diversified manufacturing capabilities could gain ground during shortages. The Chinese antitrust investigation into Nvidia highlights the regulatory risks of dominance. Such scrutiny could open doors for rivals to compete more aggressively, particularly in key markets like China. Energy efficiency is becoming a critical factor in AI hardware. Companies delivering significant energy savings through new architectures or advanced cooling technologies could gain a competitive edge. Nvidia remains the dominant force in AI chips, but the competition is closing in. Established players like AMD and Intel are doubling down on innovation, hyperscalers like Google and Amazon are developing custom silicon, and startups are pushing the boundaries with niche solutions. The Chinese antitrust investigation adds another layer of complexity to Nvidia\u2019s position, as regulatory actions could reshape market dynamics. The next phase of the AI chip race will hinge on balancing performance, efficiency, and cost while navigating a strained global supply chain and an increasingly burdened power grid. The stakes have never been higher, and the challengers are ready to test Nvidia\u2019s resilience. The future of AI hardware\u2014and the AI industry as a whole\u2014will be shaped by fierce competition and relentless innovation.

    "full_text": "The tragic death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has intensified discussions about the U.S. healthcare system's challenges. This incident has brought to light several systemic issues: Public Perception of Health Insurers: Thompson had previously acknowledged UnitedHealthcare's public relations challenges, noting that many Americans view health insurers as obstacles to care as cited by The Washington Post Industry Criticisms: Under Thompson's leadership, UnitedHealthcare faced scrutiny over policies like denying payments for certain emergency room visits and increasing prior authorization denials, which some argue restrict patient access to necessary care. Public Outcry: The assassination has garnered a controversial following, with some individuals expressing support, viewing his actions as a stand against perceived injustices in the healthcare system. This sentiment is particularly notable among younger demographics, highlighting deep-seated frustrations with the current state of healthcare in the U.S. Medical Symbol Caduceus on Crash Hole - Color Background - 3D Rendering The U.S. health insurance industry is a massive market, with a projected market size of approximately $1.4 trillion in 2024. This industry is driven by major players such as UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health, Anthem, and Humana, which collectively dominate nearly three-quarters of the market. The sector includes a diverse range of services, from private insurance plans to government-sponsored programs like Medicare and Medicaid\u200b. Specifically, technology advancements like Web3 technology, including but not limited to blockchain, cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence are poised as foundational drivers for improving the current state of the healthcare system with accessibility and affordability as its mission. With bitcoin democratizing the financial industry and the ability to bank the unbanked, it\u2019s a no-brainer that Web3 can democratize access and affordability of healthcare, challenging the current status quo of health insurers as gatekeepers. This robust revenue generation highlights the scale of healthcare spending in the U.S. and underscores the critical role that health insurance companies play in shaping healthcare access and affordability. It also explains why the industry is a key focus for policy discussions and technological innovations aimed at reducing costs while improving patient outcomes. Web3 built on decentralized blockchain systems, presents a groundbreaking solution to the challenges raised in his vision for healthcare reform. How Can Health Insurance Thrive in a Web3 Ecosystem?  Life and Health Insurance continually rank as Top 3 industries globally by revenue. The global health insurance market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4% from 2024 to 2034, reaching $3.63 trillion by 2034 partly due to growing demand for medical services and treatments, especially post-pandemic and a growing market concentration among fewer insurance companies. With growing revenues, Web3 introduces transparent pricing mechanisms through tokenized ecosystems supported by healthcare focused cryptocurrency exchanges. Healthcare Cryptocurrency Exchanges As data ownership increases in healthcare, healthcare-focused cryptocurrency exchanges have the potential to drive liquidity and affordability in healthcare through several mechanisms: 1. Incentivized Payment Systems Blockchain-based exchanges can facilitate faster and cost-effective transactions for healthcare services by using healthcare-specific tokens. This reduces reliance on traditional payment systems, which often come with high transaction fees, enabling cost savings for providers and patients. Smart contracts can automate billing, insurance claims, and payments, eliminating inefficiencies. 2. Enhanced Liquidity for Healthcare Funding By tokenizing healthcare services or providing a marketplace for healthcare funding, these exchanges can attract a global pool of investors. This model enables easier access to capital for healthcare providers, particularly in underfunded areas, and provides a liquid marketplace for healthcare-specific financial instruments. 3. Transparency in Pricing and Payments Cryptocurrency exchanges built for healthcare can offer transparent pricing structures through smart contracts. Patients and providers can clearly see service costs, reducing hidden fees and foster trust in transactions. 4. Affordable Cross-Border Payments For international healthcare services, such as medical tourism, cryptocurrency can eliminate currency exchange fees and delays, making it easier for patients to access affordable care globally. 5.  Improving Data Monetization Models Healthcare-focused exchanges can enable individuals to tokenize and monetize their anonymized health data. Pharmaceutical companies and researchers could then purchase this data, creating an additional revenue stream that can be reinvested in healthcare affordability initiatives. 6. Rewards Programs and Health Incentives Exchanges can enable incentive models where patients earn tokens for healthy behaviors (e.g., maintaining fitness goals, attending preventive care visits). These tokens can be redeemed for healthcare services, lowering out-of-pocket costs for patients. 7. Integration with Decentralized Insurance Models Crypto exchanges can also support decentralized insurance platforms where premiums and claims are handled via blockchain. These models can provide lower-cost insurance alternatives and improve access to healthcare coverage. Decentralized Financing Cryptocurrency loans have the potential to enhance affordability and liquidity in the healthcare sector by leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms. Here\u2019s how: 1. Improved Access to Capital for Healthcare Providers Healthcare providers, especially small clinics and startups, often struggle to secure traditional loans due to lengthy processes and strict requirements. Crypto loans, which use blockchain to automate and decentralize lending, provide quicker and more accessible funding. These loans can help providers invest in new equipment, expand facilities, or enhance service quality. 2. Lower Interest Rates Through DeFi Platforms Decentralized finance platforms eliminate intermediaries, reducing the cost of borrowing. Patients or providers can access loans with lower interest rates compared to traditional financial institutions. This affordability in funding can lead to more competitive healthcare pricing. 3. Flexible Payment Structures Crypto loans often offer more flexible repayment terms, such as income-share agreements or collateralized lending models using crypto assets. For patients, this means manageable financing options for expensive treatments, reducing immediate financial burdens. 4. Cross-Border Accessibility Cryptocurrency loans transcend borders, enabling patients from underserved regions to finance medical procedures globally. This is particularly impactful for medical tourism, where affordable loans can make high-quality care accessible internationally without currency exchange challenges. 5. Micro-financing Healthcare Services Crypto loans can be scaled down to microfinance levels, allowing patients to take out small, affordable loans for basic healthcare needs. This is particularly beneficial in low-income regions where traditional financing is inaccessible or unaffordable. 6. Tokenized Health Insurance Premiums Patients can use cryptocurrency loans to pay insurance premiums, while insurance providers tokenize policies for increased liquidity. This ensures continuous coverage and reduces the risk of care interruption due to lapsed premiums. 7. Transparent and Efficient Loan Processes Blockchain technology ensures that all loan transactions are immutable and transparent. This builds trust between borrowers (patients or providers) and lenders, encouraging participation in the healthcare financing ecosystem. 8. Community-Driven Funding Crypto loans can enable peer-to-peer lending where communities directly support healthcare funding. These models can foster affordable care solutions driven by decentralized, community-backed initiatives. Challenges and Considerations While promising, challenges include: By providing decentralized, accessible, and cost-effective financial solutions, cryptocurrency loans can alleviate the financial pressures of healthcare, driving both liquidity and affordability. This innovation holds the potential to bridge funding gaps and make quality care more accessible worldwide.  One Community.

Many predictions will focus on bitcoin\u2019s recent bull run, and make no mistake: its surge in value is terrific news for everyone involved in building the blockchain-powered future. But bitcoin\u2019s price is like those chocolate coins you find at the bottom of your stocking: sweet and enjoyable, but ultimately unfulfilling. The best presents are those that bring us joy, sustenance and value over the long-term, complementing the sugar rush of short-term price spikes.

The corporate adoption of Bitcoin will reach a tipping point in 2025 as major enterprises follow MicroStrategy's pioneering approach to treasury management. This shift will go beyond simple asset diversification \u2013 companies will integrate Bitcoin into their operational strategies, using it as collateral for loans, employee compensation, and international payments. Bitcoin. (Photo illustration by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) Traditional financial institutions will respond by launching comprehensive crypto services, including Bitcoin-backed mortgages and crypto-collateralized credit lines. This mainstreaming of Bitcoin in corporate finance will stabilize cryptocurrency markets, reducing the volatility that has historically deterred institutional investors. Amazon's shareholders are already taking a leaf out of MicroStrategy's book, recommending that the company diversify into bitcoin to beat inflation and increase value. I expect to see at least five Fortune 500 companies allocate more than 5% of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin by year's end. \"Best practices\" will yield to \"next practices\" as companies shift from replicating past successes to anticipating future opportunities. Tesla exemplifies this by redefining automotive norms with direct-to-consumer sales, over-the-air updates, and integrated energy solutions, creating new revenue streams like energy storage and software subscriptions. Similarly, Netflix transformed media by using AI to predict viewer preferences, investing in original content, and setting new global distribution standards. Tesla and their next practices. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). This shift prioritizes AI-driven foresight and experimentation, enabling companies to lead in disrupted industries like retail and healthcare. A next practice is a forward-looking strategy that anticipates future opportunities instead of replicating past successes. I coined the term to emphasize innovation, experimentation, and predictive frameworks to create entirely new markets and disrupt traditional business models. Ultra-short (1-5 minute) \"micro-dramas\" will revolutionize entertainment with AI-generated storylines that adapt in real-time to viewer engagement. Blockchain-based smart contracts will ensure creators are paid instantly, directly tied to audience retention and interaction. Traditional studios will struggle to match the speed and personalization of AI-native studios, with at least one surpassing a $1B valuation. As one visionary, Anina Net, Founder of 360 Fashion Network and Actress, put it, \u201cIn the future, stories will find you, not the other way around.\u201d The set of a micro drama  (Photo by Ma Jian/VCG via Getty Images) Expect streaming giants to launch micro-drama divisions while top actors team up with AI studios to create scalable, hyper-personalized content that captivates in mere minutes. A new breed of company will emerge, built from the ground up around AI capabilities. These organizations will use AI for everything from strategic planning to daily operations, creating new standards for business efficiency and adaptability. Key characteristics will include: The disruption won't come from legacy businesses retrofitting AI into existing processes but from startups that fully leverage AI at their conception. These AI-native businesses will rethink industries by building their entire structure around AI\u2019s transformative potential. As Navroop Sahdev, CEO and Founder of the Digital Economist, recently commented on a Factured Futures Webinar, \"AI-native businesses aren\u2019t just leveraging technology\u2014they\u2019re redefining the very fabric of how organizations operate. By building AI into their foundation, these companies are setting new benchmarks for agility, innovation, and impact.\" It\u2019s fascinating to watch where new AI startups are heading. The real revolution will be driven by companies that embed AI into their DNA, not by those trying to bolt it onto old systems. In 2025, transparency in AI decision-making will become a regulatory necessity, driving the development of tools that make AI outcomes clear and actionable. Companies will invest in \"AI translators\" to connect technical complexity with business needs, and natural language interfaces will become standard for breaking down decisions. As Hassan Sawaf, founder and CEO of AIXplain, says: \"Explainability isn\u2019t just a checkbox\u2014it\u2019s the key to unlocking AI\u2019s full potential, and with guardian agents, enterprises can finally safely and effectively harness it.\u201d AI Progresses (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) Organizations that embrace this shift will transform compliance into a competitive advantage, building deeper trust with customers and partners through transparent, accountable AI. In 2025, marketing will move beyond personalization into emotion-driven strategies, powered by AI capable of analyzing and predicting consumer sentiment in real-time. Instead of targeting demographics or behavior alone, AI will tap into micro-emotions detected through text, voice, and video interactions to craft hyper-relevant campaigns that resonate on a deeply human level. Imagine an AI system that adapts a brand\u2019s message based on a consumer's shifting mood during a single interaction. For example, if someone is feeling stressed while browsing, the AI could adjust the tone of the messaging to be calming and reassuring, increasing the likelihood of engagement or purchase. This level of emotional intelligence will not only enhance ROI but also redefine consumer trust by making marketing feel genuinely empathetic. As I wrote in AI First, Human Always, \"In 2025, the most successful brands won\u2019t just know their customers\u2014they\u2019ll understand their hearts, one emotion at a time.\" Content marketing expert and co-founder of Content Monsta, A. Lee Judge, adds:\"AI-powered emotion marketing is the ultimate storytelling tool\u2014it lets brands meet customers exactly where they are, emotionally and contextually, creating connections that feel personal and unforgettable.\" This shift will lead to entirely new tools for emotional analytics and spark debates about ethics in manipulating sentiment, but for those who master it, the rewards will be transformative. The adoption of branded top-level domains (TLDs) will accelerate as communities and companies recognize their potential for creating controlled digital ecosystems. These .BRAND TLDs will become central to customer loyalty programs, secure transactions, and verified digital identity systems. Early adopters will use their TLDs to create exclusive digital spaces where customers can access personalized services, special offers, and unique content. This trend will particularly impact e-commerce, where branded domains will provide an additional layer of security and trust for online transactions. Top Level Domains (TLD) Per Matthew Gould, CEO and Founder of Unstoppable Domains, \u201cCompanies and communities will increasingly adopt their own TLDs (e.g., .BRAND), leveraging them to create immersive, loyalty-driven ecosystems in Web3 environments.\u201d (Note: I work for Unstoppable Domains) Clearer global regulations will unlock unprecedented institutional investment in cryptocurrency markets. This regulatory clarity will enable: The tokenization of real-world assets will hit $16 trillion, fundamentally changing the way we own and invest. Fractional ownership of high-value assets like premium real estate and art will become mainstream, creating liquid markets for traditionally illiquid assets while slashing transaction costs and settlement times. Tokenization of Real Estate. Traditional investment firms will scramble to build tokenization platforms, while real estate companies and art galleries tokenize their assets to attract global investors. As Nina Fabbri, CEO of PropyKeys, says: \"Tokenization is turning properties into portfolios and unlocking doors for investors everywhere.\" This shift will democratize access to high-value opportunities, ensuring that anyone can own a piece of the future. Quantum computing will remain in its early stages of adoption but will show measurable progress in solving specialized problems. Financial services will experiment with quantum algorithms for portfolio optimization and risk modeling, though most applications will still be in pilot phases. Pharma companies will continue to invest in quantum research for drug discovery. Quantum-as-a-service platforms will become more accessible, enabling businesses to experiment with quantum tools via cloud services. While full-scale applications will still be years away, industries such as logistics and energy may begin testing quantum algorithms for specific optimization challenges. On the cybersecurity front, quantum encryption will gain attention, with companies starting to develop quantum-resistant security frameworks in preparation for future threats. While we won't see quantum computing disrupt entire industries by 2025, the year will be marked by prototyping, proof-of-concept projects, and increased investment, as governments and enterprises position themselves for the coming quantum era. Those at the forefront of these efforts will set the stage for the next wave of innovation, but scalability and error correction will remain key hurdles. Meme coins will undergo a significant transformation, evolving from speculative assets into tokens with real-world utility. Driven by community creativity and new technological integrations, these coins will become gateways to exclusive experiences, decentralized gaming economies, and social interactions in the metaverse. Projects like DOGE and SHIB will lead the charge by integrating utility features such as payment capabilities, staking rewards, and partnerships with major brands. At the same time, new meme coins will emerge, leveraging AI-generated narratives and blockchain-backed gamification to build loyal, engaged communities. The dog Kabosu, best known as the logo of Dogecoin (Photo by Philip FONG / AFP) / TO GO WITH ... [+] Japan-internet-crypto-meme-Doge-wow, FOCUS by Katie FORSTER with Huw GRIFFITH (Photo by PHILIP FONG/AFP via Getty Images) As meme coins gain utility, their reputation will shift, blurring the lines between humor, culture, and finance. However, their success will depend on delivering sustainable use cases and value to holders, making 2025 a pivotal year for whether they remain playful phenomena or mature into serious players in the crypto ecosystem. These predictions represent interconnected shifts that will fundamentally change how we interact with technology, content, and financial systems. Success in 2025 will require organizations to understand not just individual trends, but how they intersect to create new opportunities. The winners will be those who can harness these technologies while maintaining a human-centric approach to innovation. The future belongs to organizations that can embrace these transformative technologies while creating genuine value for users. The question isn't whether these changes will happen, but how quickly businesses can adapt to and capitalize on them. Did you enjoy this story?

    "full_text": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A clash between BlackRock (BLK) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over the money manager\u2019s holdings of US banks will now play out in the waning days of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. The FDIC has asked BlackRock to sign by Jan. 10 a \"passivity agreement\" that would codify greater checks on the money manager\u2019s holdings of FDIC-supervised lenders, according to people familiar with the matter, pushing back a deadline that was previously Dec. 31 of this year. The agreement FDIC has asked BlackRock to sign is similar to one announced last week with another giant money manager, Vanguard Group, that imposes new compliance requirements when the manager amasses more than 10% of all outstanding stock in an FDIC-supervised bank. BlackRock spent much of 2024 resisting the FDIC\u2019s push for greater oversight, denying that the asset manager exerts undue control over companies through its investment stewardship activities. As recently as December, the giant Wall Street firm proposed an arrangement with the FDIC that didn't include the same level of oversight agreed to by Vanguard. The FDIC did not respond to BlackRock's proposal until announcing its Vanguard settlement, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The tug of war between BlackRock and FDIC is the latest example of rising D.C. scrutiny of BlackRock, which oversees $11 trillion in assets. For years, the financial giant has been a target of GOP attacks about \"woke\" investing. Republicans have raised concerns about whether BlackRock\u2019s massive holdings in US corporations force companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. And Democrats have for years also been leery about whether the heft of BlackRock could pose risks to the financial system. The \"passivity\" agreement FDIC wants BlackRock to sign is designed to assure bank regulators that the giant money manager will remain a \"passive\" owner of an FDIC-supervised bank and won\u2019t exert control over a bank\u2019s board. Currently, BlackRock only has such an agreement with the Federal Reserve. Now the FDIC wants its own agreement with the money manager, which is also permitted under law. In July, FDIC board member Rohit Chopra described the FDIC's lack of oversight of passive asset manager stakes as \"highly inappropriate\" and a shirking of \"the responsibility Congress entrusted to us.\" \"Certain sectors of our economy are critical infrastructure for our country,\" added Chopra, who is also the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"We don\u2019t let just anyone own a nuclear power plant or operate a bridge.\" BlackRock has been public about its viewpoint that such additional oversight is unfounded and ultimately detrimental. Its head of regulatory affairs, Benjamin Tecmire, told the FDIC the increased oversight would duplicate what the Fed already does, according to an October letter to the agency. Tecmire said such duplication would make it more difficult for BlackRock fund investors to invest in banks, thereby harming investors, crimping banks' access to equity, and slowing capital flow across the US economy. The FDIC inquired about BlackRock\u2019s stake in 39 bank holding companies where it held a more than 10% position. Since taking those positions, BlackRock said it voted on just two of a total of 1,304 occasions against what management recommended. BlackRock also engaged with 12 of those lenders 19 times in the past three years \u201cand most of these engagements were initiated by the banking institutions themselves, not BlackRock,\u201d Tecimire told the FDIC. If BlackRock doesn't agree by Jan. 10 to the same level of scrutiny approved by Vanguard, the FDIC can take other options, according to another person familiar with the situation. Those options range from further extending the deadline to sending BlackRock a formal inquiry or even a subpoena for more information on selective communications between its stewardship team and the executives of US banks. It is not known how the Trump administration may decide to handle the BlackRock situation if it is not resolved by Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. One Republican member of the FDIC board appointed by Biden, Jonathan McKernan, called the agreement signed last week with Vanguard \"a good step in the right direction,\" saying in a statement it addressed concerns he had raised about FDIC monitoring of \u201cthe purported passivity of the largest index fund complexes.\u201d \"Those concerns have some urgency given the rapid growth of these index fund complexes and the growing body of academic work and other evidence raising doubt about whether these index fund complexes are truly passive.\" David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.

    "full_text": "Job postings listing generative AI skills are up by 400% In 2024, job postings mentioning GenAI (generative AI) increased fourfold, while nearly 50% of non-job seeking professionals recognize the value of AI upskilling, according to research shared via an email from Coursera. In fact, Google's AI Essentials course was the most popular course of the year on the platform, which demonstrates just how much AI has become an integral aspect of our workplaces and lives. Looking ahead to 2025, Coursera projects that the two fastest growing skills of 2025 will be: This conclusion was reached from analysts at the online learning platform compiling skills and course enrolment data from 2023 and 2024, and using this to forecast trends for the new year. What's important to note about these two skills is that they are both AI-related and  even more importantly, research from Indeed shows that they can bump up your salary by as much as 47% (the average salary for a professional with generative AI skills is $174,727). To paint the picture clearly for you and put this data into perspective, what this means is that if you were making $80,000 in your current job, adding AI skills like prompt engineering and applied generative AI can increase your pay to as much as $117,600 a year. That's a massive leap as far as a pay rise is concerned. But why would employers be so eager to dish out extraordinary sums of money for AI-skilled workers? An AWS report released in December 2023 helps to explain why organizations are headed in this direction. According to their survey of 3,297 employees and 1,340 organizations in the U.S. across multiple industries, their findings revealed that: Last but not least: \"Notably, while employers are willing to pay an average of 47% more for IT workers with AI skills, the study found that pay benefits will extend across departments. Employers said that they would be willing to pay workers with AI skills a premium in sales and marketing (43% higher salary); finance (42%); business operations (41%); legal, regulatory, and compliance (37%); and human resources (35%),\" says AWS. Applied AI can boost your salary by up to 47% in 2025 due to the AI talent shortage So, how should this impact your learning and professional development choices for 2025? If your goal is to boost your salary this new year, make learning AI skills\u2014particularly prompt engineering and applied AI\u2014a priority. Invest the time and money in expanding your knowledge so you can be most effective in your current role, potentially land a promotion, and have more options when it comes to applying for a new job. The good news is you don't even need to worry about the financial aspect, at least for now. There are plenty of free AI courses (and relatively affordable ones too) that you can study at your own pace online. You can even ask your employer to include this as part of your performance plan, to help hold you accountable. Make 2025 the year you boost your salary and learn skills for the future.

    "full_text": "Deep Varma is the chief technology officer at Alkami.   Open banking\u2014the systemic shift in financial services to allow account holders through secure data portability to share their financial data with third-party providers\u2014will bring greater data efficiencies and regulatory alignment in the financial industry. This technology will promote innovation and competition by enabling financial institutions to form stronger fintech partnerships, develop new products and services and gain access to data for better decision making. On the flip side, consumers will be empowered to take firmer control of their finances. Countries around the world have taken steps to adopt open banking, and with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s Personal Financial Data Rights Rule now finalized, the U.S. is now in parity with other countries, enabling it to drive innovation. I have been in Silicon Valley for over 25 years, and I believe in approaching innovation from an end-consumer mindset. As fintech and financial services leaders take steps forward toward open banking and to catch up with their global peers, the benefits to the end consumer must remain at the center. Open banking will ultimately help financial institutions attract and retain account holders through the broadening of the market, bringing more consumers to shop for their products and services. Financial institutions that adopt open banking ahead of their peers and competitors can position themselves as industry leaders, attracting tech-savvy customers and partners who value innovation and convenience. Open banking also offers the opportunity to unlock new revenue streams: Financial institutions can monetize their APIs by charging third parties for access to certain data or by entering into partnerships with fintech companies to offer co-branded services. But to fully capture the opportunities created by open banking, financial institutions need to understand its value from the end-user perspective. Open banking empowers consumers to decide when to share their financial data and with whom to share it. In the healthcare sector, patients can decide to share their medical data, like test results and health history, with new healthcare providers to receive care that will improve their health. By the same token, open banking allows consumers to own and share their financial data\u2014from a $10 transaction at the grocery store to the balance on their mortgage. To envision what the shift to a consumer-led open banking future looks like, think about a parallel evolution in the telecom industry. The 2003 Local Number Portability Act allowed consumers to keep their phone numbers when switching service providers. But as mobile phones became more sophisticated, some consumers were still reluctant to switch providers because they didn\u2019t want to lose all of the contacts, applications and data they accumulated on their phones. Fast-forward to today, and making the shift to a new device or provider is largely seamless. Consumers can replace their SIM card, or use an individual cloud-based account and transfer their data, and their new phone (with their old number) will be fully operational on the new provider network in a matter of minutes. Open banking in the U.S. will drive a similar shift in the financial services space. Today, many account holders have multiple services (direct deposit, bill pay, etc.) set up with a primary financial institution. In some respects, the system has been built to encourage account holders to remain with that single provider. If an account holder wanted to move some or all of those services to a new financial institution, they essentially needed to start from scratch. They have also been heavily reliant on the institution to make the shift for them, not having the means currently to hold and port their data themselves. With open banking, we can now see a world in which consumers own their data through a device akin to a vault or a personal finance card. If they wanted to work with a new financial institution or fintech company (e.g., to leverage different digital banking or mobile banking options), they could transfer their data easily by exchanging keys with the new provider. The process would be instant and seamless (like getting a new mobile phone is now), and the account holder would be in control the entire time. Given how important open banking is now poised to be in the U.S., banks and credit unions can position themselves as leaders through these key steps: Begin educating staff. Out of curiosity, while recently visiting a bank, I asked the teller what they thought of open banking\u2014and they had no idea what I was referring to. Financial institutions will need to build trust with their account holders, and that starts with preparation. The time is now for leaders to ascertain the level of open banking knowledge across their institutions and make plans to address gaps. Assess current technology. While the timeline for adhering to the CFPB\u2019s ruling might differ depending on asset size, all financial institution leaders need to start investigating how to bring their institutions into compliance. Leaders should ensure their organizations are ready with an action plan from the front, middle and back offices and that their technology platforms are capable of addressing this ruling. Embrace an open mind. Open banking is here to stay, and leaders should have an open mind related to the impact it will most likely have on the institution. Now is the time to embrace change and engage with tech partners to be open-banking-ready. Financial institutions should contact their digital banking platform providers and fintech partners to learn about their readiness, and providers should ensure that their underlying platforms are ready to support this ruling and provide appropriate capabilities for financial institutions to comply. As financial institutions adopt open banking and do it successfully, there will be a mindset shift where consumers own their financial data, have the right to decide when and with whom to share it and are entitled to benefit from the value of that data.

Bloated, inefficient federal government is stifling the American dream The American Dream is under siege, not by foreign adversaries or economic downturns, but by the very institution meant to protect it: the federal government. Excessive regulation has become a silent killer of innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation, weighing heavily on the U.S. economy and pushing millions of Americans into poverty.\r The numbers are staggering. Each federal regulator costs the economy $11 million annually and destroys 138 private sector jobs. With nearly 300,000 regulators employed by the government, the cumulative impact is catastrophic. The Federal Register, a measure of regulatory activity, reached a record 97,110 pages in 2016, a testament to the unchecked growth of bureaucratic red tape. This regulatory tsunami has stifled economic growth, with GDP averaging a meager 1.4% over the past decade.\r The human cost is even more alarming. Nearly 95 million Americans are out of the workforce, a staggering increase of 7 million since 2008. While the unemployment rate sits at 4.6%, this figure masks the reality of a plummeting labor participation rate, now at just under 63%. Real wages remain stagnant, and millions of families are struggling to make ends meet.\r President Obama acknowledged the problem in 2010, admitting that federal regulations \u00e2\u0080\u009chave stifled innovation and have had a chilling effect on growth and jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet, his administration added tens of thousands of new regulations across sectors like healthcare, finance, and the environment. The result? A bloated regulatory state that continues to suffocate the economy.\rHow will the Trump Administration take on bureaucracy in his second term? President Trump has made deregulation a cornerstone of his economic policy, promising to cut regulations by 75%. Early actions, such as freezing new regulations and requiring agencies to eliminate two existing rules for every new one, are steps in the right direction. However, entrenched bureaucratic interests and the slow, cumbersome nature of the regulatory process pose significant challenges.\r Research from the Phoenix Center underscores the urgent need for reform. A 10% reduction in the regulatory budget\u00e2\u0080\u0094approximately 5.6 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094could generate 1.2 trillion in GDP and create 3 million jobs annually. Even a modest 5% cut would add $611 billion to the economy and 1.5 million jobs over five years. These findings confirm what most Americans already know: reducing the size of the regulatory state is essential for economic growth and job creation.\r The regulatory burden is particularly devastating for small businesses, which lack the resources to navigate complex rules. From environmental mandates to labor regulations, the cost of compliance often forces businesses to downsize, relocate, or shut down entirely. This not only stifles innovation but also exacerbates income inequality, as opportunities for upward mobility vanish.\r As Congress and the Trump Administration grapple with how to revive the economy, cutting the regulatory budget must be a top priority. Every dollar saved in regulatory spending translates to $45 in GDP growth, a return on investment that no other policy can match.\r While politicians routinely brag about \"creating jobs\" - the facts tell a different story. Federal employees hinder free market economic principles and stifle entrepreneurship, getting in the way of economic development and DESTROYING jobs.

A 10% reduction in the regulatory budget\u00e2\u0080\u0094approximately 5.6 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094could generate 1.2 trillion in GDP and create 3 million jobs annually. Even a modest 5% cut would add $611 billion to the economy and 1.5 million jobs over five years.

    "full_text": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Ripple has announced the launch of RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, set to debut on Dec. 17. The stablecoin received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) on Dec. 10 and is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents. RLUSD will initially be available through platforms such as Uphold, MoonPay, Archax and CoinMENA, with plans to expand to exchanges like Bitso, Bitstamp, Bullish, Mercado Bitcoin, Independent Reserve and Zero Hash shortly after its release. Ripple aims to integrate RLUSD into its payment and cross-border settlement systems and eventually into its digital payment protocol by early 2025. Ripple will provide monthly independent attestations of RLUSD reserves, ensuring transparency and building trust. The company has obtained a limited-purpose trust company charter from the NYDFS, emphasizing its commitment to regulatory compliance. While RLUSD will initially not be available in the European Union due to the MiCAR regulations, Ripple is exploring ways to bring the stablecoin to that region in the future. An advisory board has been formed to guide the stablecoin's development. Members include Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Kenneth Montgomery, former COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; Sheila Bair, former FDIC Chair; and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. The board aims to enhance RLUSD's utility while navigating regulatory challenges and improving operational strategies. David Schwartz, Ripple's CTO, highlighted RLUSD's primary focus on payments and remittances, discouraging speculative trading. He noted potential price fluctuations due to limited initial supply, although the stablecoin is designed to maintain a $1 value. Early trading has already seen premiums paid by speculators, but Ripple is prioritizing its use for tokenized assets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and financial innovation. Ripple has positioned RLUSD as a competitor to established stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC. The company\u2019s payments network, which has processed $70 billion in transactions across 90 markets, is expected to support RLUSD\u2019s adoption. The stablecoin will cater to businesses and institutions by facilitating faster, cost-effective transactions, tokenized asset trading, and broader blockchain-based financial operations. By focusing on transparency, regulatory compliance, and utility in payments, Ripple aims to challenge existing players in the stablecoin market. RLUSD\u2019s launch marks a significant step in Ripple\u2019s strategy to expand its influence in blockchain-based financial ecosystems and decentralized finance solutions.

    "full_text": "Trump's return to the White House, regulatory compliance and innovation are pushing the crypto market to new highs PUBLISHED : 9 Dec 2024 at 05:06 WRITER: \n                            Nareerat Wiriyapong Bitcoin topped US$100,000 for the first time on Dec 5, jumping drastically from roughly $69,000 the day before the US presidential election about a month earlier. The sharp uptick in price has prompted investors, particularly cryptocurrency enthusiasts, to keep a close eye on what happens next in US politics. As a candidate, Donald Trump pledged to make the US the \"crypto capital of the planet\". Now the president-elect even suggested the country might one day pay off its national debt in cryptocurrency. \"During the campaign, Trump promised many policy changes in the US that will be favourable for Bitcoin and crypto assets in general. We have already seen the impact of this, driving Bitcoin prices to all-time highs,\" said Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance, the Thai joint venture between the world's largest crypto exchange and SET-listed Gulf Energy Development. In Mr Nirun's view, these policies are likely to be pushed through. Trump's second term, unlike his first, will have a Republican majority in the Senate and House of Representatives. \"This means he can drive his campaign policy very effectively. His campaign advisors, especially Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr, are also very pro-Bitcoin, so I think these pledged policies will be implemented,\" he told the Bangkok Post. CRYPTO BOOST Mr Nirun said before the US election, Bitcoin was already a well-known and widely adopted asset globally. In the US, many institutions and state pension funds are starting to invest in the world's largest cryptocurrency. \"New regulations, if they happen, will make Bitcoin even more mainstream. I believe Bitcoin will become a mainstream investment asset, similar to gold or silver, in the future,\" he said. Mr Nirun said the general cryptocurrency market will likely follow Bitcoin, with more assets becoming mainstream, taking the Ethereum path. \"I think the key driver will be greater innovation. With supportive US policy and more capital returning to the US, we will see more innovation in this space, with new applications and use cases driving crypto assets to become more mainstream in the future,\" he said. The market anticipates Gary Gensler, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), leaving his post at the end of Joe Biden's administration. Investors are optimistic about a more crypto-friendly regulator after his departure in early 2025. \"He was very active in regulatory enforcement on Bitcoin and crypto assets. The new SEC chairman will likely be much more aligned with Trump's views,\" said Mr Nirun. Last Wednesday, Trump announced he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the SEC. Mr Atkins, the chief executive of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, has made the case against too much market regulation since he left the US stock market regulator. However, realising the benefits of favourable crypto policies of the new US administration will take time, said Mr Nirun. \"I think we need to wait for the proper timing. There are a lot of pressing issues Americans expect Trump to tackle, including the economy and immigration, which will likely come first. We need to wait a bit to see when he will start looking into Bitcoin and crypto assets,\" he said. \"The devil is in the details. Crypto is a complex issue and drafting a new law for this will take time.\" The FIT21 bill, a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, was previously passed by the House and is now waiting in the Senate. \"If Trump wants to redraft the entire bill, this will take even more time,\" said Mr Nirun. \"Hopefully the next SEC chairman is someone with a strategic vision for crypto in the long term.\" Binance co-founder Yi He shared a similar view, saying products such as spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds have broadened the industry's circle, and these increasing overlaps and innovations indicate a good year is ahead. STABLECOIN OPTIMISM Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, expressed optimism regarding global regulation of the sector. He believes the next 10-12 months will be crucial for the stablecoin space, which has already grown to roughly $170 billion, with Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC responsible for the lion's share. However, this is a fraction of the global financial space and the $130-trillion global electronic money market. This means the stablecoin industry still has huge potential for growth, said Mr Allaire. A type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a fixed value relative to another asset or currency, stablecoins are often pegged to a traditional currency, namely the US dollar or the euro, or other assets such as gold or silver. \"The next 12 months is a pretty big inflection point for stablecoins,\" he said, with regulatory frameworks in some key jurisdictions expected to take shape over the next year. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, Mr Allaire likened these early days of digital currency to the early days of digital media, explaining how lowering communication costs spurred rapid growth and revolutionised industries. He suggested achieving similar advancements in transaction costs with programmable money could fundamentally reshape the ways we transfer and manage value in the financial landscape. USDC, Circle's stablecoin, has increasingly been adopted across financial and payment networks, suggesting stablecoins are poised to become a foundational layer in the digital economy, with real-world applications expanding from here, said Mr Allaire. In terms of regulation, he was cautiously optimistic, noting the regulatory environment in several countries had positive sentiment for stablecoins. While a certain level of regulatory hurdles remains, a shift in attitudes among policymakers is taking place, particularly in the US, which is now recognising the long-term value that digital assets can bring, said Mr Allaire. In fact, even those voicing public opposition to the sector or sitting on the sidelines are watching the vanguard, ready to follow suit with comprehensive regulations, he said. This openness can pave the way for a balanced approach that supports innovation without stifling progress, said Mr Allaire. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE Ms Yi acknowledged the past year posed significant challenges, even for industry leaders such as Binance, to sustain growth momentum. With more than 200 million users globally, the world's largest crypto exchange remains focused on building a brighter future for the sector and increasing financial accessibility, she said. Navigating industry-wide regulatory and compliance challenges is an ongoing priority for Binance. While such challenges are complex, Binance views them as necessary for long-term growth and trust within the ecosystem, said Ms Yi. Collaboration with regulators is crucial to achieving mass adoption. \"If we want a billion users of crypto, we must cooperate with the regulators. That's how we become the next Google or Amazon of crypto,\" she said. Access is essential to Binance, as Ms Yi hopes her grandmother or a nanny can easily open the Binance app and use crypto. Noah Perlman, chief compliance officer of Binance, said as more of the world transitions from traditional finance to blockchain, global regulations and compliance is becoming more important than ever. \"We can all agree that 2023 was the year in which regulators and policymakers really stepped up their efforts to develop frameworks for the industry,\" he said. \"It is very difficult to follow the rules if they are constantly changing.\" Having regulations that are difficult to follow or deny product users what they want inevitably pushes users to unregulated spaces, said Mr Perlman, who has a background in traditional finance, adding regulatory frameworks offer certainty, which markets crave. \"As we get more certainty in the market through policies such as MiCA, it is going to encourage more people to enter the space,\" he said, referring to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation that came into force in June 2023. Yuelin Li, chief product officer of tech startup Onfido, said a clear regulatory framework provides \"a sense of safety for consumers\", which is the defining factor between those who are willing to give crypto a shot and those who prefer to stay within the realms of traditional finance. Bora Erdamar, director of BlockchainIST Center, an R&D centre for blockchain technology, said the roles of project developers and experts help to bridge the gap between the crypto ecosystem and conventional finance. \"We need to make it easier to understand and use blockchain,\" he said. 2025 TRENDS Alex Svanevik, chief executive of leading on-chain analytics platform Nansen, believes 2025 will see the \"biggest bull run in history\", supported by Trump's victory in the US election. For next year, meme coins -- cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes -- will continue to attract retail investors to the crypto space. He anticipates these tokens will significantly boost on-chain metrics, leading to unprecedented records in decentralised exchange (DEX) volumes across multiple blockchain networks. \"Meme coins continue to onboard retail to crypto and smash on-chain metrics. We'll see new records in DEX volume for lots of chains,\" he said. \"Better infrastructure, easier user experience, lower transaction fees -- all these make the journey on-chain better for newcomers.\" Mr Svanevik also foresees a resurgence in decentralised finance (DeFi), driven by clearer regulations and the activation of revenue models within DeFi protocols. With the departure of Mr Gensler from the SEC on Jan 20, he predicts regulatory hurdles will be reduced and institutional capital will flow more freely into DeFi platforms. Mr Svanevik said he envisions cryptocurrencies playing a dual role in accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) projects and offering solutions to mitigate associated risks. \"Crypto accelerates AI, but also protects us from AI,\" he said, adding crypto dollars should continue to pour into AI projects. Binance chief executive Richard Teng said the future is bright for crypto. \"We are on the path of mass adoption because every major global financial institution is either embracing crypto or pushing ahead with the blockchain agenda,\" he said.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.  \n     \n      The regulatory developments and the actions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on fintech entities in 2024 received widespread coverage. The unease felt by the sector was expressed in various forums. \n     \n      Consequently, fintech companies got an audience with the finance minister. RBI initiated monthly meetings to increase engagement. It also issued a licence for a self-regulatory organization for fintech (SRO-FT). \n     \n      So, is the narrative of the fintech sector facing regulatory headwinds really true? \nAlso read: Armed with RBI sanction, first fintech self regulator to ramp up enforcementIn 2024, out of nearly 340 cases of enforcement action by RBI, 75% pertained to cooperative banks. Eighteen private banks and seven state-run banks also faced monetary penalties. In comparison, less than 10 fintech entities were penalized.\n\n     \n      These numbers do not seem to support the view that the fintech sector is under increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\n     \n      Aggregate data often overshadows nuances. So, we analyze a few instances to understand if they qualify as \u2018regulatory overreach\u2019.\n\n     \n      The aggressive interpretation of regulations on First Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG) resulted in RBI instituting prescriptive guidelines. A fintech firm with an innovative product idea or capability to identify potential borrowers using alternate data would want to tie up with a non-banking financial company (NBFC) or bank to lend.\n\n     \n      At the same time, the lender would like to reduce the risk of non-repayment by this new segment of borrowers. By providing an FLDG, the fintech company agrees to bear these losses up to an agreed percentage.\n\n     \n      In the absence of any regulatory restriction, such tie-ups were often concluded at high FLDG rates, sometimes even up to 100%.\n\n     \n      In effect, the fintech partner was operating like a lender without a licence. The consequent regulatory action of capping the FLDG at 5% was much debated for its impact on innovative lending models.\n\n     \n      In the case of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms, the regulations were violated. These platforms are licensed to play the role of matchmaker and facilitate lending/borrowing transactions between individuals.\n\n     \n      P2P platforms cannot entice lenders by offering a cap on the possible losses due to non-repayment of loans.\n\n     \n      The mixing of funds in disbursal and collection streams is not allowed. In practice, a few P2P platforms started behaving like banks by offering assured minimum returns and liquidity options to lenders. This led to enforcement action from RBI and more prescriptive guidelines.\n\n     \n      In contrast, inferences from the notification asking Navi FinServe to desist from disbursing fresh loans in October can be called ambiguous. A key reason for the regulatory clamp seems to be high interest rates charged. In response, Navi reduced its interest rates on personal loans, leading to a reversal of its ban in less than 45 days.\n\nAlso read: Why do we need regulation for fintech firms?For customer protection, RBI must guard against \u2018interest rate gouging\u2019 by lenders. But the answer to what qualifies as a \u2018high\u2019 rate and whether a cap should be prescribed is not clear.\n\n     \n      Aggregate data and these instances indicate heightened media interest instead of a regulatory siege. In this context, it is important to appreciate that the financial sector is unlike other industries. The regulator is tasked with developing the sector while ensuring overall stability of the financial system and customer protection.\n\n     \n      Encouraging innovation is important for the sector\u2019s evolution. The list of innovations facilitated by RBI and institutions it has been instrumental in founding (NPCI, RBIH) is impressive.\n\n     \n      Think of 24X7 fund transfers (IMPS/ NEFT/ RTGS), the Unified Payments Interface, Rupay, Aadhaar-enabled Payment System, Bharat Bill Payment System, Account Aggregator system, United Lending Interface (ULI), etc.\n\n     \n      Fintech startups have leveraged these innovations, the assimilation of which in a non-disruptive manner is equally important for the stability of the financial system. Currently, some distance needs to be travelled to bridge the gap between regulatory expectations and industry standards.\n\n     \n      A November survey by Grant Thornton opines that a lot more needs to be done in this area. The regulator has been reiterating that governance, risk management and customer grievance redressal are key themes for the sector to focus on. However, fintech lenders do not see these as major risks for their business operations.\n\n     \n      These findings seem to support the views expressed by T. Rabi Shankar, deputy governor of RBI, in his speech on \u2018Fintech and Regulation\u2019. He discussed \u201can unexpected regulatory challenge which one might characterise as compliance-aversion.\n\n     \n      Financial entities traditionally subject to regulation understand that regulation serves the larger objective of systemic stability and development.\n\n     \n      Entities outside the financial space are still learning to adapt to a regulated environment. Consequently, their initial reaction to regulation is objection.\"\n\n     \n      One way to reconcile this supposed regulatory misalignment is through self-regulation. The SRO-FT licence provides an RBI recognized platform to evolve a consensus on contentious issues. It should be used to curb attempts at gaining from regulatory arbitrage.\n\nAlso read: Budget 2024: Fintechs push for policy overhaul, seek regulatory clarity, improved licensing, tax reforms\n\n     \n      Transparency can be increased by prominently displaying interest rates and charges on fintech apps and websites.\n\n     \n      The SRO-FT could take a lead and publish the interest rates of its members on its website. Collaboration with the regulator to identify and call out rogue fintech players/illegal apps should be strengthened.\n\n     \n      Fintech has an important role to play in making financial services in India future-ready and these steps will help it achieve its promise faster.\n\nThe author is an economist and researcher.

    "full_text": "Bank of America flagged potentially suspicious payments involving Jeffrey Epstein and Leon Black in February 2020 and again in October 2020, a year after Epstein's death. The transactions in question, totaling $170 million, occurred years prior.  The timing of the filings has raised concerns about potential violations of federal money laundering laws, prompting a congressional investigation into Bank of America's actions.  Bank of America did not file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) within the standard 60-day window, indicating an institutional failure to comply with regulatory protocols.  The delay in reporting has raised suspicions of intentional inaction and prioritization of high-net-worth client relationships over public safety.  The Senate Finance Committee's investigation highlights the need for stricter oversight and accountability within the banking sector, with calls for a more robust and responsive framework to prevent financial crimes.

The Senate Finance Committee's investigation highlights the need for stricter oversight and accountability within the banking sector, with calls for a more robust and responsive framework to prevent financial crimes.   The Bank of America only flagged potentially suspicious payments involving convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former CEO of Apollo Global Managemen Leon Black a year after Epstein's death.\r The bank submitted two suspicious activity reports (SARs) to regulators in February 2020 and again eight months later, but the transactions in question had occurred years prior, totaling a staggering $170 million.\r The timing and nature of these filings have prompted intense scrutiny, with congressional investigators now questioning whether Bank of America violated federal laws against money laundering. The delays raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of the financial sector in detecting and preventing illicit activities, particularly when it comes to wealthy clients.\r SARs are a crucial tool in the fight against financial crimes. They are designed to alert authorities to potential money laundering, terrorism financing and other unlawful activities. Yet, in this case, Bank of America failed to file these reports within the standard 60-day window, choosing instead to wait until well after the death of Epstein.\r This delay is not just a bureaucratic oversight; it's a sign of institutional apathy and, perhaps, intentional inaction. By processing these large payments without seeking any additional information, the bank appears to have prioritized its relationship with a high-networth client over public safety.\r For years, these transactions likely slipped under the radar, potentially aiding in the perpetuation of Epstein's illegal activities. When the payments were finally flagged, it was only after media outlets began reporting on the deep ties between Epstein and Black, suggesting that external pressure may have been the only catalyst for action.\r The office of Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) has taken note, with his Finance Committee recommending a full investigation into Bank of America's handling of these transactions. The committee has been investigating the payments for nearly two years, highlighting the need for stricter oversight and accountability within the banking sector.\r Black has maintained that the payments were for legitimate tax work and art transactions, insisting that he did not know about Epstein's criminal activities. However, this defense rings hollow given the lack of clear justifications for such large, seemingly purposeless transfers.\rBank of America committed disregard for regulatory protocols and public safety The revelations about Bank of America's delay in reporting come at a critical time, as the financial industry grapples with the balance between privacy and transparency. The Senate Finance Committee's investigation underscores the importance of due diligence when it comes to high-risk clients. Banks must be more proactive in identifying and reporting suspicious activities, rather than waiting for media inquiries to prompt action.\r Banks file millions of SARs each year, but the lack of immediate action in cases like this demonstrates the need for a more robust and responsive framework. If banks are truly committed to preventing financial crimes, they must be willing to take swift and decisive action, rather than waiting for external pressures to force their hand.\r Regardless if the delay was a result of negligence or deliberate inaction, the bank has shown a disturbing disregard for regulatory protocols and public safety. This case is a stark reminder that the financial industry must do better in identifying and reporting suspicious transactions, especially when it comes to high-profile clients with questionable histories.\r One thing is certain: The financial sector can no longer afford to ignore the potential for criminal activity among its most prominent clients. It's time for banks to prioritize due diligence and regulatory compliance over maintaining relationships with wealthy clients. The stakes, as demonstrated by this case, are simply too high.\r The committee's recommendations should serve as a wake-up call for the entire banking industry. More needs to be done to ensure banks are not just ticking boxes but taking proactive steps to prevent financial crimes. Only through rigorous oversight and accountability can we hope to address these systemic failures and protect the integrity of our financial system.\r Until then, the public must demand greater transparency and accountability from banks like Bank of America, ensuring that their focus remains on upholding the law and protecting public safety, not just generating profits for their wealthy clientele.

    "full_text": "A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\t\t\t\t\t In the second \u201cPolicies That Work\u201d panel, Wharton experts discussed the major concerns AI poses for regulators, and how they could be addressed without harming innovation. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKartik Hosanagar\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Werbach\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefano Puntoni\t\t\t\t\t\t Shankar Parameshwaran The versatility of AI applications and their rapidly expanding user base have focused the spotlight on regulators and the need to provide guardrails for the technology. Wharton experts delved into that and related topics in a recent session of a new Wharton series called \u201cPolicies That Work.\u201d Stefano Puntoni, Wharton marketing professor and co-director of AI at Wharton, moderated the panel on \u201cAI, Technology, and the Role of Regulation\u201d with Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, and Kevin Werbach, Wharton professor of legal studies and business ethics and department chair. Watch the full panel or read some key takeaways below:  Werbach put the major concerns with AI into three buckets: safety, governance, and abuses. On safety, advanced AI models, especially foundation models for generative AI, could cause catastrophic harm. While the potential for them to become \u201csuper intelligent and a threat to humanity\u201d is remote, he said, \u201cthere are certainly possibilities we could see mass casualties and attacks on critical infrastructure \u2014 really severe harms.\u201d Accuracy, bias, privacy, intellectual property, and transparency are other major concerns. The prevalence of bias is worrisome, for instance, when AI is used for sensitive decisions like hiring or lending, and there are challenges to transparency in that decision-making. Governance would also have to address issues such as data privacy and concentration of market power. Abuses could take the form of deliberate misuse of AI systems, such as misinformation, deepfakes, and cybersecurity abuses. Hosanagar picked deepfakes as the biggest issue that warrants regulatory attention. \u201cDeepfakes can create civil unrest, and democracies should be worried about it.\u201d Cybercrimes, especially in financial fraud, and pornography are other scenarios for deepfakes. According to Werbach, \u201cThe biggest gaps [are in areas where] we don\u2019t have any structure that\u2019s addressing serious problems.\u201d Generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, Character.ai, and other general-purpose large language models (LLMs) \u201ccan be incredibly valuable and useful, but also potentially dangerous.\u201d He pointed to cases where active users have committed suicide. Before detailed regulation, he recommended \u201cappropriate guardrails.\u201d Another area that lacks a regulatory structure is biometrics, especially facial recognition, which has been used for flight safety or to identify shoplifters. Evidence has shown that these biometric systems \u201ccan be highly inaccurate and highly biased,\u201d such as against darker-skinned people, if firms don\u2019t take care to mitigate those problems, Werbach said. He pointed to a recent case involving drug store chain Rite Aid, whose facial recognition tool to prevent shoplifting came under the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cDeep fakes can create civil unrest, and democracies should be worried about it.\u201d\u2014 Kartik Hosanagar AI regulation must strike the right balance which addresses \u201clegitimate concerns about equity, welfare, and safety, [without] stifling innovation,\u201d Puntoni said. \u201cThe risk is if you over-regulate, then you stifle innovation,\u201d Hosanagar said, noting that \u201cthe center of innovation\u201d shifts away from states or countries that regulate heavily. Hosanagar identified two approaches for AI regulation. One is that it should be issue-specific, instead of a broad-based approach that will bring \u201ccompliance headaches \u2026 to hundreds of other use cases that are harmless.\u201d For instance, such regulation could focus sharply on, say, deepfakes and financial fraud, instead of broader fields such as LLMs or image models in general, he said. The second approach is to create regulatory sandboxes for innovation. These sandboxes allow companies to try out their innovations, and for companies and regulators to track the relevant data, Hosanagar said. He cited the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which has a regulatory sandbox for financial use cases of AI; and Dubai, which covers emerging technologies. \u201cNo country in the world is really seriously trying to regulate all AI,\u201d Werbach said. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on use cases, or they\u2019re focused on risk.\u201d The U.S. does not have a specific federal law focused on AI regulation, but existing laws cover many potential concerns, such as unfair and deceptive practices, or discrimination. Some recent initiatives do address AI governance issues. The Biden administration in October 2023 issued an executive order on \u201cthe safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use\u201d of AI, which set out detailed requirements for government agencies to better understand the issues with the technology, and put in place procedures for investigations. The executive order is not binding on the private sector, but it will have an indirect effect, Werbach said. \u201cThe U.S. government is the biggest purchaser of everything, including AI technologies.\u201d The U.S. is poised to shift gears on AI regulation from a focus on risk management under the Biden administration to efforts to \u201cunshackle AI\u201d in the coming Trump administration, Werbach continued. Trump\u2019s donors and campaign participants, including Elon Musk, \u201cthink the potential is there for this technology to be many orders of magnitude better, more powerful, and more valuable for the economy and for America. And they think regulation is standing in the way.\u201d That said, the future course of AI regulation in the U.S. is less clear, as the Trump campaign has targeted big tech but has also spoken of unshackling companies from regulation. \u201cNo country in the world is really seriously trying to regulate all AI. They\u2019re focused on use cases, or they\u2019re focused on risk.\u201d\u2014 Kevin Werbach AI developers are not, however, waiting for clarity. \u201cCompanies are voluntarily doing AI governance, and engaging in these standards processes, because they want the AI to be trusted,\u201d Werbach said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have a situation where they build something and it\u2019s discriminatory, or one of their users commits suicide.\u201d While it is premature to speculate on the shape of federal AI laws under the Trump administration, state-level AI regulation is moving forward. Some 700 AI bills are pending in U.S. states, and dozens have been adopted, including in California and Colorado, Werbach said. One high-profile bill in California (SB 1047) was recently vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Singapore, the U.K., the European Union, and China have taken concrete steps to regulate AI. Singapore, for instance, released a Model AI Governance Framework earlier this year, which Hosanagar characterized as business friendly. The EU earlier this year passed its AI Act, which Werbach described as \u201ccomprehensive, top-down, detailed, and prescriptive.\u201d It has a risk-based approach, where it identifies \u201chigh risk\u201d uses of AI such as in hiring, defense, criminal justice, finance, and education. The EU is currently in \u201ca process of standardization and engagement\u201d with its AI Act. China has adopted at least three enforceable laws already on AI, which are focused on recommender systems, deepfakes, and generative AI systems. China also requires approval and licensing to deploy chatbots with public-facing LLMs, preceded by a standardized and structured test. In framing regulations to prevent bias in AI systems, policymakers must recognize that they confront issues that may be rooted in either technical, ethical, legal, or governance shortcomings. Hosanagar said bias in AI models may originate from training data; that could be mitigated by bias detection tools, or data resampling, or fixing data gaps. For instance, data is sparse for minority groups, and technical solutions for that could include data resampling or using fairness-aware machine learning approaches, he added. Shortcomings in algorithms used for hiring or credit scorings could take on a legal dimension if they invoke anti-discrimination laws. Bias is also an ethical issue, and it raises fundamental questions such as how to define fairness, or who gets to define it. \u201cThe difficulty is when you deploy algorithms into social systems, and you have bias emerging as an interplay between algorithmic and human decision-making,\u201d said Puntoni. Bias can be a tricky issue to regulate. \u201cHuman decision-makers are incredibly biased, and they can hide their biases behind explanations that seem to make sense,\u201d said Hosanagar. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to hide AI biases. [But] the problem with AI biases is that they scale. A biased judge in a courtroom affects a few thousand lives. If you use an AI system to guide a judge\u2019s sentencing decisions, and it is biased, it affects millions of lives.\u201d \u201cThe difficulty is when you deploy algorithms into social systems, and you have bias emerging as an interplay between algorithmic and human decision-making.\u201d\u2014 Stefano Puntoni Bias cannot be regulated away with just blanket rules. Instead, Werbach recommended toolkits for technical, ethical, and governance issues along with the evolution of standards and best practices. Other ways to resolve accuracy issues are to have governance frameworks that incorporate explainability and human-in-the-loop requirements. For instance, if an AI system rejects a loan application, it could come with an explanation. In other settings where AI cannot be fully autonomous, human intervention could fix accuracy problems. Accuracy is also \u201ca huge challenge,\u201d especially when generative AI systems create hallucinations or confabulations with generative AI, Werbach said. He advised against laying down regulatory thresholds arbitrarily, noting that generative AI systems \u201cdon\u2019t understand in any kind of human way how they relate to the real world.\u201d But Werbach made an exception for AI safety: \u201cIf we are worried about catastrophic harm, then we need to at least have some arbitrary threshold. It will be highly imperfect, but we need to really ensure that we mitigate these very, very severe risks.\u201d The EU also has barriers for what it considers unacceptable uses of AI, such as emotion detection in schools and the workplace, and large scale, real time biometric scanning, he noted, although the U.S. may not draw the same lines. AI systems \u2014 especially massive, general purpose, large language model generative systems \u2014 require massive amounts of energy to be trained. Training costs for foundation models such as those of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic can range from hundreds of millions of dollars to a billion dollars, going up to $10 billion or $100 billion \u201cpotentially, if the scaling laws hold,\u201d Werbach said. Data centers consume about 10% of the energy in most U.S. states. The combined energy consumption of data centers in the U.S. is roughly equivalent to three times that of New York City and is projected to triple in the next four years, Hosanagar noted. Some companies have taken big steps to meet those energy needs. Microsoft has signed a deal with Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania; it was retired in 2019 because it became economically unviable. Constellation will invest $1.6 billion to restart the plant, and Microsoft has agreed to buy power from it worth about $800 million annually for 20 years. Google and Amazon have also placed orders with next-generation small modular nuclear power companies. The push to try \u201cevery method possible to get more energy generation in the U.S \u2026 will really put pressure for innovation,\u201d especially in nuclear power, Werbach noted. Such innovation will also focus on making AI systems more efficient, and in developing better architectures for neural networks, Hosanagar said. Regulators, too, will have an expanded role in thinking about energy security and related issues such as pricing implications for consumers, he added. AI clearly presents a big opportunity for collaboration between companies on self-governance, standards, and best practices. One initiative is the Partnership on AI, where tech companies have come together to create pathways for AI governance and implementation. On the competitive dimension, it is crucial to have a \u201ca regulatory backstop\u201d below which companies should not be able to go in ensuring the right governance, including accuracy, fairness, and transparency, Werbach said. Without those baselines, companies will \u201crace to the bottom\u201d just because they have to compete, he added. \u201cWe want to have a race to the top.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t expect Silicon Valley to be the place that will take a governance-first approach.\u201d\u2014 Kartik Hosanagar That \u201crace to the top\u201d gets help from direct government funding, incentives, education, and immigration, especially in the Biden executive order on supporting AI, Werbach said. He expected the Trump administration to \u201cdouble down on all of that.\u201d Incentives where companies can game the regulatory process must be removed; instead, incentives must be set up in a way where \u201cself-interest is actually of collective benefit,\u201d he added. As Puntoni saw it, companies could take proactive steps on AI governance \u201cbecause they are afraid of regulation and want to prevent heavy handed [punitive measures].\u201d Or, they could try to gain \u201ca direct influence on regulation\u201d through lobbying, or what is known as \u201cregulatory capture.\u201d \u201cRegulatory capture is a big concern,\u201d Werbach said. \u201cWe need better policies, and better regulatory structures that don\u2019t get captured.\u201d Hosanagar suggested that open-source technologies could be an option. That approach could prevent regulatory capture because it would lower or eliminate entry barriers, and thus soften the competitive instincts in companies. On the other hand, it would be hard to regulate open-source AI models because their users would be far too many and it would be difficult to track their activities. While regulation sets the requirements, liability is a \u201cvery powerful tool \u2026 [where] someone\u2019s going to sue you,\u201d Werbach noted. He cited the biometric privacy law passed in Illinois in 2008, which provided protections against unauthorized use of biometric information of individuals. \u201cThis is the most significant AI law ever passed in terms of actually influencing companies,\u201d he said. The case forced Facebook to shut down its photo tagging technology and pay users $550 million in settlement. With regulatory compliance, companies could get rewards such as grants and incentives, but competitive advantage is another driver of best practices. Hosanagar cited the AI-powered search engine Perplexity AI, which focused its innovation on transparency and accuracy. \u201cIt\u2019s not because they want to do good. It\u2019s because that gives them a competitive advantage.\u201d But competitive instincts alone cannot be expected to do the governance job well; strong regulation is an imperative. \u201cDon\u2019t expect Silicon Valley to be the place that will take a governance-first approach,\u201d Hosanagar said. Above all, the emphasis must be on education, according to Hosanagar. \u201cI would require \u2026 every school to have an AI literacy program in middle school and high school. I would, in fact, require every student to create deepfakes. I would probably want every person on earth to spend a lot of time creating lots of deepfakes. Once you do it a few times, you start to realize what this is about, and you start to realize, \u2018Everything I see has to be questioned.\u2019\u201d \nThis article is part of the Policies That Work Series.

    "full_text": "xml file The European Union is undergoing a major shift in how it approaches tax compliance, with several member states introducing mandatory e-invoicing. While the shared goal is to reduce fraud, the approaches to implementation differ greatly, reflecting each country\u2019s unique tax system, infrastructure, and policy priorities. This article explores the forthcoming e-invoicing mandates in Poland, Germany, Belgium, and France. It outlines the timelines, highlights the key aspects of each country\u2019s approach, and provides practical insights to help businesses prepare for these changes. Poland's journey toward mandatory e-invoicing has encountered numerous delays, reflecting the complexity of implementing such a significant shift in tax infrastructure. The country has chosen a centralized e-invoicing model, requiring electronic invoices to be processed through the National e-Invoicing System, known as KSeF (Krajowy System e-Faktur). This government-operated platform serves as a hub for the issuance, receipt, and storage of electronic invoices. KSeF has been available for voluntary use since January 1, 2022, giving businesses time to familiarize themselves with its functionality. However, the mandatory implementation of the system has been repeatedly postponed due to technical challenges and concerns about its impact on businesses. Originally scheduled to become compulsory by mid-2024, the rollout was delayed after an external audit revealed irregularities in the KSeF's infrastructure. Poland revised the implementation timeline in May 2024, establishing a phased approach. Under the updated schedule, KSeF will become mandatory from February 1, 2026 for businesses with a registered office or fixed establishment in Poland that reported sales exceeding PLN 200 million in 2025. For all other businesses, the obligation will take effect on April 1, 2026. This phased implementation is intended to ease the transition and allow businesses of varying sizes to adapt at their own pace. Under the KSeF system, taxpayers will create structured invoices in XML format according to the e-Faktura FA(2) specifications, using their own ERP systems. These invoices will then be transmitted to KSeF via an API. Upon receipt, each invoice will be assigned a unique identification number and timestamp, ensuring authenticity and traceability. A structured electronic invoice not transmitted to KSeF will be regarded as not issued. The mandatory use of KSeF will apply exclusively to business-to-business (B2B) transactions. For consumer transactions, the use of KSeF will remain voluntary, allowing businesses the flexibility to choose the invoicing approach that best suits their operational needs. To further support taxpayers during the transition to mandatory e-invoicing, the Ministry proposed several simplification measures in November 2024. One significant update will allow invoices to include attachments, reflecting feedback from key stakeholders, particularly energy, gas, and telecommunications providers. Micro-entrepreneurs\u2014those issuing invoices with a total amount not exceeding PLN 450 per invoice and with total sales under PLN 10,000 in a calendar month\u2014will be permitted to issue invoices outside the KSeF system until September 30, 2026. Additionally, certain specific requirements, such as including the KSeF number in payments for invoices issued via KSeF or through cash register systems, have been postponed to July 31, 2026. Taxpayers will have the option to issue invoices offline until the end of 2026, enabling businesses to create e-invoices even when technical issues prevent immediate submission to KSeF. However, these offline invoices must comply with the structured e-invoice format and be submitted to KSeF by the next business day to ensure compliance. Furthermore, a grace period has been established: no penalties for non-compliance with KSeF obligations will be imposed until the end of July 2026, offering additional reassurance to taxpayers during the adjustment phase. A significant unresolved issue is the potential misalignment between Poland's KSeF system and the European Union's VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) framework. From 2030, VIDA will require businesses to issue cross-border invoices in a standardized EU format. By 2035, this obligation will extend to domestic transactions in countries that choose to mandate e-invoicing for domestic sales. Poland\u2019s KSeF system uses a more complex e-invoicing format than the EU standard, raising concerns that Polish businesses might need to invest additional time and resources to adapt their systems to comply with VIDA in the future. In March 2024, Germany enacted a law requiring the use of electronic invoices for domestic B2B transactions. On October 15, 2024, the Federal Ministry of Finance published detailed guidelines for implementing this e-invoicing mandate, which will be rolled out gradually from 2025 to 2028. Starting January 1, 2025, businesses involved in domestic B2B transactions must be capable of receiving electronic invoices. Germany defines an electronic invoice as one issued in a structured electronic format compliant with EN 16931 or in a format agreed upon by the issuer and recipient, provided it enables the correct and complete extraction of required information in line with EN 16931 or is interoperable with it. Germany's widely used invoicing formats, ZUGFeRD and XRechnung, comply with the criteria for electronic invoices. The obligation to receive electronic invoices also extends to foreign e-invoicing formats such as the French Factur-X and Peppol-BIS Billing, which are compatible with EN 16931. The Finance Ministry emphasizes that the choice of format is a civil law matter that must be agreed upon by the contracting parties. The Ministry has also clarified that the requirement to receive electronic invoices can be met by providing an email inbox; it does not need to be a dedicated inbox solely for receiving e-invoices. However, contracting parties may agree on alternative permissible transmission methods. The rollout of mandatory e-invoicing obligations in Germany will be implemented in phases. In 2025 and 2026, businesses may continue issuing paper invoices or electronic formats that do not comply with EN 16931 standards, as long as they have the recipient\u2019s consent. Starting in 2027, companies with an annual turnover exceeding \u20ac800,000 in the previous year will be required to issue electronic invoices. These businesses can still use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems instead of fully adhering to EN 16931 standards, provided the recipient agrees. From 2028 onward, all businesses in Germany will be required to issue electronic invoices, marking a complete transition to digital invoicing nationwide. The e-invoicing obligation will apply exclusively to domestic B2B transactions. Businesses based in Germany will be required to issue electronic invoices for supplies taxable in Germany if the recipient is also located in the country. The mandate will not extend to business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, certain exempt B2B transactions, invoices for amounts below \u20ac250, or tickets. The guidelines do not mandate a specific method for transmitting e-invoices, leaving the decision to the contracting parties. Acceptable transmission methods include email, electronic interfaces, or download portals. While supplementary information may be included in an unstructured PDF attachment, all mandatory details must be contained within the structured data of the invoice. Contracts can also be attached, and for recurring obligations, a new e-invoice is necessary only when there are changes to mandatory invoice details. The German e-invoicing mandate aligns with the European Union\u2019s VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) initiative, particularly the adoption of the EN 16931 standard. However, unlike some other European countries, Germany will not require e-invoice data to be reported directly to the tax authorities. Such a reporting obligation is expected to be implemented at a later stage. Belgium is preparing to implement a mandatory e-invoicing system for B2B transactions, starting January 1, 2026. This requirement will apply to all VAT-registered businesses that are established or have a fixed establishment in Belgium. Unlike other countries that adopt a phased approach based on company size or specific conditions, Belgium\u2019s mandate will apply universally from the outset. E-invoices must be issued for all taxable transactions that are not exempt and are deemed to take place in Belgium. Belgium distinguishes between structured electronic invoices and ordinary electronic invoices. An ordinary invoice includes all mandatory data and is issued and received in electronic form, such as a PDF. Starting January 1, 2026, ordinary electronic invoicing will no longer be allowed for transactions between VAT-registered Belgian businesses. Instead, businesses will be required to issue structured electronic invoices that comply with the EN 16931 standard. These invoices must use the PEPPOL BIS format or another EN 16931-compliant format agreed upon by the parties. Belgium has adopted the PEPPOL network as the standard for exchanging structured electronic invoices. To connect to the PEPPOL network, businesses need to register with a certified access point provider. Structured electronic invoices must always be sent and received via the PEPPOL network unless both parties explicitly agree to use an alternative method. To support businesses in the transition to mandatory e-invocing, the government has introduced several measures aimed particularly at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and self-employed individuals. Starting January 1, 2025, the investment allowance for digital infrastructure improvements will increase to 20%, encouraging businesses to upgrade their invoicing systems. Additionally, for taxable periods from 2024 to 2027, SMEs and self-employed individuals using subscription-based invoicing software can benefit from an increased expense deduction of 120%. Belgium\u2019s e-invoicing mandate aligns with the European Union\u2019s ViDA initiative, particularly the adoption of the EN 16931 standard. Belgium has not yet proposed mandatory digital reporting requirements. Such a reporting obligation is expected to be implemented at a later stage. France is preparing to introduce mandatory e-invoicing and e-reporting obligations, with a phased implementation starting in 2026. The reform is based on Law No. 2022-1157, which defines an electronic invoice as one that is issued, transmitted, and received in a fully digital format containing a minimum set of structured data. The e-invoicing mandate will apply to domestic transactions between businesses established and registered for VAT in France. Certain transactions, such as those related to education, healthcare, and financial services, which are exempt from VAT and do not require invoices, are excluded. While foreign businesses without an establishment in France are not subject to the e-invoicing requirement, they may still need to comply with e-reporting obligations if they conduct taxable transactions in France. Originally scheduled to begin on July 1, 2024, the rollout of the mandatory e-invocing was postponed. Under the revised timeline confirmed in Law No. 2023-1322, all businesses must be able to receive electronic invoices by September 1, 2026. On this date, large and intermediate-sized enterprises (known as Entreprises de Taille Interm\u00e9diaire or ETIs) will also be required to issue electronic invoices. Small and medium-sized enterprises will follow suit, with the obligation to issue electronic invoices taking effect on September 1, 2027. The French government initially intended to provide a public invoicing portal, the Portail Public de Facturation (PPF), to manage the exchange of electronic invoices. However, in October 2024, it was announced that the PPF would not function as a free tool for issuing or receiving invoices. Instead, its role will be limited to maintaining a directory of recipients and serving as a tax data hub. Businesses will therefore need to use certified private Partner Dematerialization Platforms (PDPs) to handle their invoicing processes. PDPs are certified service providers authorized by the French tax authorities to facilitate the issuance, transmission, and receipt of e-invoices. Businesses can choose a PDP from an official list of approved providers. These platforms validate invoices to ensure they comply with regulatory and technical standards, checking for any errors or missing information. After validation, the PDP transmits the e-invoice to the recipient\u2019s platform and submits the required data to the public tax data hub. France allows e-invoices to be issued in three approved formats: Cross Industry Invoice (CII), Universal Business Language (UBL), and Factur-X. PDPs enhance seamless communication and interoperability by converting invoices into a format compatible with the recipient\u2019s system. In addition to e-invoicing, France is introducing e-reporting obligations for transactions not covered by the e-invoicing mandate. These include B2C sales and cross-border transactions, such as imports, exports, and intra-Community supplies and acquisitions. Foreign businesses that conduct taxable transactions in France and are required to charge French VAT will also need to comply with the e-reporting requirements. These obligations will follow the same phased timeline as the e-invoicing rollout. The e-invoicing and e-reporting obligations also extend to businesses in French overseas departments such as Martinique, Guadeloupe, and R\u00e9union, where VAT is applicable. However, businesses located in the French overseas collectivities, including French Guiana, Mayotte, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia, where VAT does not apply, are exempt from e-invoicing. These businesses may still be required to comply with e-reporting obligations for taxable transactions conducted in France. Poland, Germany, Belgium, and France demonstrate diverse approaches to implementing mandatory e-invoicing. The most notable difference lies in their choice of data transmission models. Poland has adopted a centralized system, requiring businesses to exchange invoices through its National e-Invoicing System. In contrast, France plans to use private platforms to handle both invoice data reporting and exchange. Belgium has designated the PEPPOL network as the default standard for e-invoice exchange, whereas Germany will grant businesses complete freedom in choosing their invoice transmission methods. Neither Belgium nor Germany has introduced invoice reporting requirements yet. The rollout timelines also vary significantly. Belgium has opted for a universal implementation, requiring all VAT-registered businesses to issue structured electronic invoices from the outset, without a phased approach. Meanwhile, the other countries have chosen gradual rollouts, with Germany\u2019s particularly intricate transition rules standing out for their complexity. There are additional differences regarding the impact of these measures on non-resident businesses. Companies holding local VAT registrations but without physical establishments in Poland, Belgium, or Germany will not be affected by these upcoming mandates. However, such businesses may be subject to France's e-reporting requirements.

These rules, which mandate that all public companies disclose material cybersecurity incidents within four business days and detail their risk management strategies, highlight that cybersecurity is a board-level risk management concern. As part of their fiduciary duties, boards play a key role in the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. In partnership with senior executives, they need to pay close attention to the risks their companies face and the strategies those companies put in place to comply. As the rules were authorized in late 2023, we shared what we see as the implications for infosec leaders. This post explores the impact of these regulations after one year. We also look at recent enforcement actions and measures that companies should consider adopting to promote compliance and bolster their cybersecurity posture. An important note: In 2025, there will be changes in SEC leadership, which could affect these rules. But they\u2019re just one example of the additional attention governments around the world are giving to cyber risk. The EU recently issued the network and information systems (NIS)2 Directive, aimed at improving cybersecurity across member states. It requires the reporting of \u201csignificant\u201d incidents within 24 hours, a more detailed report within 72 hours and a final report within a month. Other more focused rules, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, although it doesn\u2019t have incident disclosure provisions, have driven significant change for companies that want to do business in that region. It comes down to trust. Tenable CEO Amit Yoran had a clear point of view when he wrote about the rules as they took effect. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s rule will force what companies should have been implementing all along; informed cyber risk management practices,\u201d he said. \u201cRequiring companies to provide annual updates of their cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance and report material breaches within four business days will force leadership to pay attention and keep customers and investors better informed as to who they trust with their business.\u201d With that as a backdrop, CISOs looking to support stakeholders like legal, finance, investor relations and boards in these efforts should understand a few things about the SEC rules. The SEC requires public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining their materiality using an 8-K form. This requirement aims to give investors timely and relevant information about potential risks that could impact business operations and financial performance. At a conference held by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in December, Sebastian Gomez Abero, Associate Director of the Division of Corporate Finance (DCF) Disclosure Review Program emphasized that materiality, rather than the discovery of a breach, is the trigger for disclosing a cybersecurity incident. According to an EY summary of his remarks provided by the conference organizations, Gomez Abero also reminded registrants that both quantitative and qualitative factors should be considered in their materiality assessment of a cybersecurity incident. In addition, companies must include descriptions of their cybersecurity risk management and governance practices annually in their 10-K or 20-F reports. The rules essentially validate cybersecurity as an important component of risk management, within a robust corporate governance program. Recent 10-Ks from a number of companies incorporated these new requirements. According to the EY conference summary, Gomez Abero reminded registrants to provide sufficient detail in their annual cybersecurity disclosures for a reasonable investor to understand the organization\u2019s processes to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, rather than just stating that a process exists. In addition, registrants that have a management group to assess material cybersecurity risk need to disclose each member\u2019s individual expertise. Since the introduction of the cybersecurity rules, the SEC has taken significant enforcement actions to ensure compliance, including issuing fines and negotiating settlements with various companies. For example, in October 2024, the SEC fined Unisys Corp., Avaya Holdings Corp., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. and Mimecast Limited a combined total of almost $7 million for allegedly misleading disclosures related to their exposure to the SolarWinds cyberattack. In the same order, the SEC alleged that these firms downplayed their involvement, which led to misleading investors about potential impacts. Each company settled without admitting or denying the allegations. In another notable enforcement action by the SEC, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (RRD) agreed in June 2024 to pay more than $2.1 million for inadequate disclosure and poor management of significant cybersecurity incidents from 2021. The SEC found that RRD\u2019s internal processes failed to properly elevate and disclose these incidents to senior management in a timely manner, underscoring the importance of having robust incident management frameworks in place. There are three key lessons to keep in mind as you work to help your organization meet the SEC cybersecurity requirements: So what can a CISO do about this? It starts with a comprehensive cybersecurity program, including exposure management, which gives CISOs the information they need to communicate with legal, finance, investor relations, boards and other internal stakeholders about vulnerabilities and cyber incidents so that those can be appropriately captured in the company\u2019s cyber risk management and public reporting. Exposure management equips an organization with the tools needed to meet the SEC\u2019s cybersecurity disclosure requirements by aligning cybersecurity efforts with business risk management. Exposure management provides comprehensive visibility into the organization\u2019s attack surface, prioritizes vulnerabilities based on their potential business impact and delivers actionable insights that inform the preparation of risk management filings. Moreover, exposure management is part of a cyber program that can identify cyber risks and incidents that may need to be reported in filings. With easily understood, dynamically updated dashboards that a CISO can use to gain visibility into companywide exposures, exposure management is critical for ensuring compliance and demonstrating a strong security posture. Plus, an exposure management strategy that integrates asset visibility, risk prioritization and incident response \u2014 along with strong partnerships between the CISO, legal, IR and finance \u2014 ensures that organizations can accurately report their practices and responses at any point in time because of the continuous monitoring built into exposure management. By focusing on vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat to business operations, companies can allocate resources effectively and build a cybersecurity program that supports regulatory compliance. For CISOs, adopting an exposure management program ensures they can provide legal, finance, investor relations, boards and other executives with clear, actionable insights into the organization\u2019s cybersecurity risks. Exposure management helps inform decision-making and supports the development of comprehensive risk management frameworks, enabling companies to address threats proactively and build confidence among investors and stakeholders. The entire C-suite should approach the SEC\u2019s new rules with an eye toward integrated and forward-looking cybersecurity strategies. As part of that effort, it\u2019s crucial to develop and maintain comprehensive incident response plans that can be deployed swiftly to meet the four-day disclosure mandate. To meet the SEC\u2019s cybersecurity disclosure rules and reduce the risk of breaches that could lead to significant regulatory and financial consequences, organizations must adopt proactive strategies that strengthen their defenses. The following preventative measures outline key steps companies should take to enhance their cybersecurity posture and ensure compliance. The SEC\u2019s cybersecurity disclosure rules underscore the critical importance of transparency and proactive risk management in today\u2019s digital landscape. Although compliance requires effort and resources, it also presents an opportunity for companies to build trust with investors and stakeholders. By prioritizing robust cybersecurity practices that focus on prevention, enterprises can better align with regulatory expectations and be prepared for critical reporting requirements. They can close exposures and become resilient, responsible leaders in an increasingly risky world.

    "full_text": "Hrishikesh Joshi, Enterprise Architect, Okta Inc.   Imagine a world where anyone can build software without any coding experience. With low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms, this vision is becoming a reality, unleashing creativity and redefining who holds the keys to technological innovation. Low-code/no-code platforms simplify development with visual interfaces and pre-built templates, allowing individuals without extensive programming knowledge to build functional software. These platforms make technology more accessible by democratizing app development. They empower more people to create apps and automate tasks, offering both opportunities and challenges as businesses undergo digital transformation. The rise of LC/NC platforms has significantly transformed software development, enabling \"citizen developers\" to create applications without extensive programming knowledge. However, the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through advanced large language models (LLMs), has further disrupted the industry. The market for low-code development platforms, valued at $6.78 billion in 2022 according to Grand View Research, is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. While exact figures vary between sources, Gartner forecasted the worldwide low-code development technologies market to reach $26.9 billion in 2023, with a growth rate of 19.6% from 2022. The market is expected to continue growing, potentially reaching $94.75 billion by 2028. This growth stems from the demand for fast, adaptable software creation. These platforms connect IT departments with business users, fostering collaboration and streamlining development. These platforms do more than cut development time and costs; they help unlock the creative potential of employees. By allowing individuals from various departments to design the tools they need, these platforms can help boost creativity and productivity. In industries such as finance, healthcare and retail, companies use them to streamline processes, improve customer service and adapt to market changes. The ability to rapidly prototype and iterate on solutions allows businesses to be more agile, responding quickly to customer needs and market trends. Generative AI has overhauled the essence of coding. In its early iterations, AI lacked the ability to perform even basic mathematical reasoning, which limited its application in generating sophisticated algorithms. However, the announcement of OpenAI's Q* (\"Q Star\") brought significant advancements, enhancing LLM capabilities to incorporate rudimentary logical reasoning. As a result, citizen developers found themselves equipped with tools that could generate complex applications and solve problems previously reserved for skilled programmers. This shift raises a critical question: Should software professionals embrace this technology as a means to alleviate the burden of repetitive coding tasks, or should they be concerned about the potential for obsolescence in an evolving market? The \"fear of being obsolete\" (FOBO) resonates among developers, highlighting the tension between technological advancement and job security. Despite its advantages, LC/NC faces critical limitations. Security management remains a concern, with LC/NC applications sometimes lacking the robust safeguards of traditionally coded software. Integration with legacy systems and scalability to enterprise levels are also hurdles, especially in complex corporate environments. On top of that, as LC/NC platforms continue evolving, governance frameworks must address code verification and validation challenges, including differences between LLM-assisted coding, LC/NC packages and autonomous coding practices. The integration of AI into these platforms complicates matters, as AI-generated code may introduce errors or vulnerabilities that are challenging to detect with traditional validation methods. Striking a balance between innovation and security will be essential as organizations seek to leverage the benefits of LC/NC tools in conjunction with generative AI. As more business users adopt low-code/no-code platforms, IT departments must establish robust governance frameworks to maintain oversight while empowering citizen developers, preventing shadow IT scenarios where unauthorized or poorly designed applications could create security vulnerabilities and operational inefficiencies. Organizations should implement regular cross-functional architectural reviews involving enterprise architects, security teams and business stakeholders to assess platform configurations, integration patterns and data flows across the application landscape. Early engagement with legal and compliance teams is crucial to identify regulatory requirements, data privacy concerns and potential risks before citizen developers begin their projects while establishing clear documentation standards and approval workflows can help maintain visibility and control. Additionally, implementing automated code analysis tools specifically designed for low-code/no-code platforms combined with mandatory training programs for citizen developers on security best practices and organizational standards can reduce the risk of security incidents and ensure sustainable scaling of these initiatives. The convergence of LC/NC platforms and generative AI heralds a new era of workforce development. As coding becomes increasingly accessible, the demand for traditional programming skills may shift. However, this will also allow developers to focus on higher-level tasks that emphasize creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving\u2014areas where human ingenuity still reigns supreme. Moreover, the potential for speech- and thought-driven coding interfaces promises to further streamline the development process. By enabling developers to articulate their ideas verbally or through simple commands, these advancements could enhance accessibility and encourage greater innovation in software design. The future of low-code/no-code platforms is promising, with advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning set to enhance their capabilities. As these technologies evolve, they are likely to further increase the functionality and usability of low-code/no-code platforms. Beyond typical corporate applications, LC/NC\u2019s influence may expand into high-performance computing (HPC) and academic research, where executable papers and reproducibility are priorities. The democratization of software development through LC/NC platforms and the potential for speech-driven coding interfaces hint at a global impact, empowering users across various markets to innovate without traditional programming expertise. As LC/NC adoption grows worldwide, it is poised to reshape workforce dynamics, especially in regions with emerging digital economies. The rise of low-code/no-code platforms, combined with the capabilities of generative AI, is transforming the way software is created, enabling more people to contribute to the development process. This shift not only sparks innovation but also requires organizations to implement strong governance frameworks to mitigate risks and ensure quality. By embracing these tools strategically, companies can boost efficiency and nurture a culture of creativity. The future belongs to those ready to adapt and harness these advancements to address the challenges of tomorrow.

The minister also informed that DGGI had no reciprocal arrangements with foreign governments for information sharing and enforcement measures to block such websites. He asked the ministry to state: (a) whether the Goods and Services Tax (GST) investigation arm DGGI has suggested reciprocal arrangements with foreign Governments for information sharing and enforcement measures and to block websites to prevent tax evasion in OIDAR [Online Information Database Access and Retrieval] services like e-gaming and online education; (b) if so, the details thereof; (c) whether the DGGI has noticed entities like online casinos that appear to intentionally avoid tax compliance; and (d) whether these entities are non-cooperative and hence an information exchange with global law enforcement agencies would help crack down on any evasion? Concerning the non-cooperative entities, the response said that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had been informed about such websites during the investigation, as per the provisions of Section 14A(3) of the IGST Act, 2017.  At the GST Council Meet 2023 held in July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a 28% GST levy on the total game value for online gaming, horse racing, and casinos. This effectively placed skill-based games, such as rummy and poker, on par with gambling games (online games of chance) under India\u2019s tax regime. Industry players severely criticised the move, arguing that imposing such a tax burden, where taxes exceed revenues, would threaten the existence of the gaming industry and further boost black-market operators. Following this announcement, GST revenue from online gaming increased nearly fivefold, rising to Rs 6,909 crore from Rs 1,349 crore between October 2023 and March 2024. This tax regime leaves out offshore betting sites, thus, leaving a lacuna in the regulation of online gambling. In April 2024, the GST authorities notified over 60 offshore gaming platforms to MeitY, requesting it block them for non-compliance with India\u2019s registration laws. This notice followed similar action against 110 other gaming platforms. Even though online gambling and betting are illegal in the majority of states, offshore betting platforms have managed to operate with impunity and avoid regulatory oversight. They also perpetrate harms like financial losses, gambling addictions, and enticing minors. Taking into account such harms, advocacy groups have recommended several measures like imploring the central government to develop laws that are \u2018extra-territorial\u2019 in their jurisdiction and instituting nodal agencies to monitor offshore gambling sites.  \n\n\nSupport our journalism: \n  \nSign up for our Daily Newsletter to receive regular updates\nStay informed about MediaNama events\nHave something to tell us?

    "full_text": "FinTech Remitly and Wester Union Over the past decade, the world has undergone a profound transformation\u2014a shift to instant digital experiences\u2014that has reshaped industries and recalibrated consumer expectations. The Covid-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated this transition, embedding the \u201cAge of Instant\u201d into our daily lives, making digital convenience a non-negotiable. Somewhere along the way, our iPhones and Android devices became our command centers, capable of summoning rides, controlling our homes and delivering a world of goods to our doorsteps. Today, these experiences define consumer expectations. Fast, frictionless, and reliable interactions have become the currency of modern consumer culture\u2014and a growing number of C-suite leaders, from Comcast to Starbucks, grapple with how to meet these demands. What happens when those demands aren't met? A trust gap emerges. When Robinhood (HOOD), a platform built on the promise of democratizing finance, halted the purchase of GameStop stock during a trading frenzy, it wasn\u2019t just a disruption; it was a betrayal. The platform many trusted to empower everyday investors appeared to side with institutional players, shattering confidence and igniting backlash. Since then, I\u2019ve advised and interviewed dozens of AI and tech CxOs, including top fintech CEOs from Brex, Highbeam, Affirm, RecargaPay, and Remitly on The Reboot Chronicles Show. One thread in all of those conversations has been trust. From the world\u2019s biggest companies like Walmart and United Airlines to emerging growth brands, C-suite leaders are developing partnerships with these fintech companies, while navigating uncertainties of the digital-first economy\u2014and one lesson is clear. Trust is not a luxury. It is the foundation of everything: from innovation and partnership deals to consumer relationships and transactions. Sound simple? It\u2019s not\u2014especially when you are talking about people\u2019s money. That\u2019s the ethos embraced by digital payments companies who are rebooting the financial services trust gap in global payments. From behemoths like Western Union and MoneyGram to emerging growth companies like PayPal/Xoom, Wise, Remitly and dozens more\u2014there is no shortage of aggressive competition in this sector. When you look behind the scenes of this active disruption crime scene, there are broader go-to-market and consumer insights that C-suite leaders can learn from. While ordering next-day delivery or hailing a ride with a tap on a screen might feel effortless, the same can\u2019t always be said for sending money across borders\u2014a process that impacts millions of lives but remains fraught with unseen complexity and cyber threats. Delays, opaque fees, poor communication and high barriers to access can all erode trust in cross-border payments. For an industry handling over $1.8 trillion annually, these pain points represent both a challenge and an opportunity. I know people who rely on these services. One, lets call her Maria, lives in New York and sends money weekly to her parents in Guatemala. These funds cover essentials that can\u2019t wait like food, medical care, and utilities. Traditionally, Maria would visit a local MoneyGram or Western Union location during business hours, complete a lengthy process, and maybe pay hefty fees. Even small delays could mean her family doesn\u2019t receive funds in time to pay urgent bills. Maria\u2019s experience is not unique. Research shows that over 85% of funds sent via remittances go toward non-discretionary expenses such as housing, healthcare, and education. Cross-border payments are a vital lifeline for millions globally, yet moments of friction can quickly erode customer trust. Emerging providers have tackled these challenges head-on by focusing on speed, cost and accessibility. When I sat down with Remitly (RELY) CEO, Matt Oppenheimer, I learned over 90% of the company\u2019s transfers are completed within an hour with a take rate of less than 3%\u2013saving customers $800 million in fees last year. Operating in 170 countries with billions of bank accounts and mobile wallets, and thousands of cash pickup options, its global payment network seems convenient and accessible. Yet, my takeaway from our discussions is that they\u2019re just getting started. \u201cEvery customer expects a fast, affordable transfer,\u201d says Matt Oppenheimer, CEO of Remitly. \u201cAnd trust is built when we deliver peace of mind in the moments that matter most. This philosophy drives our relentless effort to reduce friction across the customer journey, leveraging AI and advanced systems to address problems that many overlook - beginning with access.\u201d Western Union (WU), where I used to work, has been rebooting itself\u2014and working on disrupting the disruptive disruptors. President and CEO Devin McGranahan has been on mission to \u201cfind and fix the friction,\u201d and seems to be making progress on his Evolve 2025 plan. He is focused on stabilizing their declining retail business and accelerating digital services through organic growth, partnerships, and probably acquisitions. WU is a big ship to turnaround at scale. With a global network of 600,000 agents in over 200 countries and territories, which send $100 billion between 120 million senders and receivers per year\u2014they need to keep doubling down on digital services. McGranahan addressed WU\u2019s digital progress and how he is improving experiences by reducing friction and transaction times, stating on a recent earnings call, \u201cIn addition to driving traffic at the top of the funnel, we\u2019ve also made meaningful progress in simplifying the customer journey and improving our funnel conversion rates. As part of that process, we have simplified the branded digital customer profile creation. We have reduced the steps required for a customer to complete a transaction and have modernized our user interface and moved from a multipage transaction funnel to a single page modular view.\u201d Each year, millions of people living and working abroad encounter significant hurdles to accessing financial services. Many traditional banks rely on outdated risk models that evaluate customers using documentation that a globally mobile worker may not have, like a local home address, bank account, credit history or social security number. They may also avoid serving high-risk markets or transaction corridors due to the intricacies of regulatory compliance and potential for financial crime. Companies like Remitly are charting a different course, leveraging robust regulatory partnerships and pioneering a risk and compliance framework explicitly designed for the needs of globally mobile workers. This forward-thinking approach makes it possible to serve customers in traditionally underserved regions. It ensures that families across the globe who rely on remittances receive secure and timely financial support\u2014no matter where they are. One of the biggest surfaces for friction is behind the scenes of the money movement process itself. Global money markets are anything but predictable. In the time it takes for funds to travel from Canada to India, exchange rates can shift, significantly impacting the value of transfers sent to loved ones abroad. Instead of waiting for funds to move through the global financial network\u2014which introduces customer risk and delay\u2014Remitly\u2019s global treasury system anticipates demand and pre-stocks currencies in recipient countries. By ensuring funds are ready when customers need them, the company prevents many of the challenges that traditionally slow transfers. Central to this strategy is the use of AI-powered forecasting. Leveraging real-time data on seasonality, historical trends, and market movements, Remitly\u2019s advanced models predict currency demand with remarkable accuracy. Updated hourly, these forecasts enable the company to pre-purchase currencies at optimal rates, generating both time and cost savings that I assume they can pass on to customers. As Oppenheimer notes, \u201cThe biggest challenges to cross-border payments are our competitive advantages.\u201d For businesses operating in unpredictable markets, our strategy demonstrates how AI can transform volatility into reliability to improve speed and drive down costs for customers.\u201d As transaction speed increases, so can risk. In 2023, consumers reported losing more than $10 billion to fraud\u2014a staggering 14% increase from the previous year, according to the FTC. This alarming trend presents a challenge for financial service providers: how to safeguard customers from ever-more sophisticated fraudsters while maintaining the speed and convenience modern consumers expect. It's crucial to strike a balance between security and efficiency as traditional fraud prevention methods, involving lengthy verification processes or overly cautious transaction flagging, can frustrate users and erode trust. Just as fraudsters have used AI and machine learning to increase the velocity and scale of attacks over the past several years, companies have doubled down on the same technology to detect and respond to threats in real-time. By leveraging ML-driven models capable of analyzing thousands of transactions per hour, Remitly identifies nuanced patterns and anomalies in real-time. Unlike traditional rules-based systems, these models are highly adaptive and precise. With each interaction, the system improves its ability to distinguish genuine threats from everyday activity. This approach may be paying off. Last year, the company was able to reduce both fraud interventions and losses as fraudsters adopted increasingly complex tactics. The results point to what all CxOs want\u2014stronger fraud protection and faster, more seamless customer experiences. For financial leaders hesitant to integrate AI and machine learning into their fraud prevention protocols, it's a stark reminder that avoiding these technologies may pose a greater risk. Fraudsters today can launch dozens of attacks simultaneously, a scale unimaginable just a few years ago. These strategies, from financial services providers, seem to offer an encouraging blueprint to effectively counter this surge in online scams and fraud, using the same technology to protect customers without slowing them down. By the time a customer reaches out to support, they\u2019re already navigating what Oppenheimer calls, \u201cThe Valley of Doubt\u201d \u2013 moments of anxiety that can define a customer\u2019s relationship with a company or service. Do you recall how you felt with your very first Lyft or Uber ride? I do. It\u2019s worse than that feeling of doubt. \"Trust isn\u2019t built solely in moments of perfection; it\u2019s earned in moments of uncertainty,\u201d says Oppenheimer. \u201cRemitlians see every challenge as an opportunity to prove that we\u2019re worthy of the trust our customers place in us.\u201d Like other companies across sectors, they deployed an AI chatbot to address common money transfer issues\u2014and report that the bot can resolve routine inquiries four times faster than a human representative, while maintaining similar satisfaction ratings. With AI solutions, CxOs in the broader financial services sector are learning that in more complex or sensitive interactions, customers need access to human agents, ensuring that personalized attention is available when it\u2019s needed most. For CxOs looking to deploy that type of agile AI CX, there are plenty of vendors that can help. The Age of Instant isn\u2019t over. Meeting the expectations of today\u2019s customers requires more than operational upgrades\u2014it demands a strategic commitment to innovation and trust-building. Fintechs provide some good lessons for C-suite leaders, underscoring the importance of aligning technology with real customer needs, ensuring that solutions don\u2019t just deliver speed but also foster reliability, security, and accessibility at every touchpoint: Elevate Customer-Centric Design: Products and services must be built around the realities of global customers, addressing their unique barriers and expectations. Deploy AI with Strategic Intent: Innovation must be led by the problem it\u2019s solving in order to simplify, protect, and enhance the customer journey\u2014not add layers of complexity. Combine Scalability with Precision: Whether it\u2019s customer onboarding, fraud detection, or support, systems should operate efficiently without losing the personal connection that drives trust. In a world where customer loyalty is built transaction by transaction, the ability to innovate thoughtfully will define the next generation of leaders. Company leaders that understand this shift\u2014and act with clarity and purpose\u2014are poised to shape not just their industry sector but the future of customer experiences itself.

The company has also enhanced its finance suite in Mexico and Germany, among other markets. \u201cFor a long time, the US was at the top. But after GST, India overtook the US as the largest market. I used to read about how in India, it\u2019s difficult to make money with software. But in 2022, our new revenue in India exceeded that of the US, so that\u2019s an inflection point because we proved money could be made here if you do it right. India is among the top markets, and we are also doing well in the Middle East,\u201d he noted. Ganti also noted that Zoho has the largest-selling accounting software in the Middle East, and the UAE in particular. It has a presence in other markets, such as the UK, Kenya, South Africa, Mexico, and Germany. Following the launch of the German edition of the finance suite last year, the company is now supporting e-invoicing capabilities that align with the German government\u2019s requirements. Zoho also announced the addition of key capabilities in its finance and operations applications, which will help Mexican businesses and accountants enhance operational efficiency, simplify routine financial tasks, and ensure regulatory compliance. The new features are introduced in Zoho Books, SAT\u2019s CFDI-compliant cloud accounting, Zoho Practice, an accounting practice management application built for accountants, and Zoho Inventory, an order and inventory management application. \u201cGenerally, the accounting software needs to be configured for the local market. It\u2019s more challenging specifically from a compliance standpoint. In Kenya, we are doing well because they had this invoicing requirement and came up with something called eTIMS, or an electronic tax invoice management system, which can be directly linked to the Kenyan Revenue Authority. In Kenya, arguably, we were the first to develop that,\u201d he said. The company has an edition for South Africa, is a ZATCA-approved player in Saudi Arabia, and connects with HMRC, the UK\u2019s equivalent of the Revenue Authority. Other products like the travel and expense part of the finance suite can be used globally, Ganti stated. Zoho serves customers in 150+ countries. The Zoho finance suite provides 15 country-specific editions and one global edition. The company intends to expand into more markets. \n\t\tComments\n\t\t BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

We recently published a list of 11 Best Consulting Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to look at where FTI Consulting, Inc.

According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the Consulting Service Market is valued at $354.01 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $447.72 billion by 2029, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.81%. This growth is driven by several key factors, including the increasing complexity of business operations, the rapid evolution of technology landscapes, and a heightened focus on strategic decision-making.

In just two years, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) transformed its AI consulting revenue from zero to an impressive one-fifth of its total earnings. Likewise, McKinsey is forecasting that 40% of its business will soon be AI-related. AI is redefining efficiency in consulting.

Advanced tools like these not only enhance internal processes but also provide clients with actionable intelligence that drives strategic advantage. In addition to efficiency, AI is enabling innovative business models, such as subscription-based services for continuous AI insights. AI tools are also transforming strategic decision-making by offering unbiased, data-driven insights. PwC is investing $1 billion in AI over three years, which underscores the importance of integrating AI into business strategy. According to BCC Research, the global AI consulting services market is experiencing rapid growth, growing at a 34.2% CAGR from 2023 to 2028, rising from $64.3 billion in 2023. The consulting service market is on the cusp of substantial growth, fueled by the increasing complexity of business operations, the rapid pace of technological evolution, and a heightened focus on strategic decision-making.

The preferred European euphemism is \u201ccompetitiveness.\u201d With Trump reportedly considering shrinking, merging, or removing banking regulators in the U.S. altogether, and ally Elon Musk calling for the elimination of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as part of sweeping government cuts, the stage is set for a frenzy of deregulation on Wall Street \u2014\u00a0if not beyond. In November, many were caught off guard when European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signaled a similar gear shift for Europe with her red-tape-slashing agenda for her second five-year term. European institutions now have little choice but to pay close attention. The head of the French central bank, Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, warned in November that \u201ca wind of deregulation\u201d was blowing from across the Atlantic, cautioning that it could reshape the global regulatory landscape. Wim Mijs, head of EU banking lobby the European Banking Federation, told POLITICO that EU banks were alert to Trump\u2019s \u201caggressive deregulation agenda\u201d and his potential distancing of America from multilateral institutions where global finance rules are agreed.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet in Europe it\u2019s competitiveness, not deregulation, that has become the catch-all term for such responses, thanks in large part to the publication of two landmark reports this year by former Italian prime ministers Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi. Responding to President Joe Biden\u2019s massive spending programs \u2014 dubbed Bidenomics \u2014 both reports called for a radical shakeup in how Europe\u2019s financial markets operate to better compete with the United States and China. Trump\u2019s renewed push for deregulation has only added substance to their findings, putting further pressure on Europe to adapt or risk falling behind. All of this poses an awkward conundrum for the bloc\u2019s financial regulators, none of whom wish to be held responsible for another financial crisis, but who risk looking out of touch amid the industry-pleasing push for lighter regulations. On one hand, loosening rules could help Europe stay competitive; on the other it risks undermining safeguards meant to prevent another financial crisis. \u00a0The EU\u2019s new finance commissioner, Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque, highlighted the dilemma when she revealed during her confirmation hearing that she doesn\u2019t \u201clike the word deregulation.\u201d \u201c[The finance sector] needs regulation because of the consequences when it fails,\u201d Albuquerque said. But she appealed to both sides, saying the EU needs to \u201cput the brakes on legislation temporarily\u201d and to think carefully about how to make future legislation more fit for purpose. Thus far, despite the eagerness of industry, Albuquerque has proved more regulatorily hawkish than hoped. In political negotiations she has criticized the dilution of new rules to the point they no longer deliver on the goals of original proposals. Hence, some say, the appeal of the \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d moniker: It\u2019s direct enough to be impactful, but vague enough to be plausibly deniable. \u201cThe beauty of a political buzzword is that it is used in every political speech without attaching any meaning,\u201d Mijs said, adding that often \u201cnobody knows [what meaning is intended], but it feels good.\u201d Those worried about a deregulation cycle triggering a destabilizing race to the bottom should look to the bigger picture, finance executives say. Many have quietly worried for some time about the complexity of the EU regulatory environment. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Courtois, deputy CEO of French insurer AXA and president of the EU insurance lobby, told POLITICO that complexity stood to make the bloc \u201ctoo risk-averse, too cautious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we should compete with the U.S. on deregulation. I\u2019m saying that we are not isolated and that we need to have good regulation that doesn\u2019t impact negatively our competitiveness,\u201d de Courtois said. To his mind, Trump\u2019s return could be a positive trigger if it encourages Europe to change. \u201cWe just need to stop regulating,\u201d he said. For Mijs, regulatory simplification of this kind is urgently needed to make finance rules more workable. \u201c[In the EU] we die by beautiful intentions because we start with something that is simplifying and it\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the process, we have built something that is like a spaghetti of rules that is incomprehensible.\u201d Regulatory fatigue is also top of mind. In total, about 50 new financial services laws have been passed in the last five years, many of these being positioned for secondary rulemaking in the years to come. For instance, the latest rules on the use of outside IT providers by finance firms have the industry bracing for a deluge of follow-up technical rules, legitimizing industry claims that compliance will hinder corporate investment.  Sandro Pierri, CEO of BNP Paribas\u2019 asset management wing, said for asset managers, who are bound by fiduciary duty \u2014 a commitment to provide the best returns for their clients \u2014 the current regulatory burden obliges them to invest elsewhere whether they like it or not. \u201cOur job is to simply make sure that we deploy the capital in the best possible way for the clients. \u2026 It\u2019s a policy job to create the conditions for us to allocate more to Europe,\u201d he said. EU countries have also been calling on the Commission to slash red tape. In October, France, Germany and Italy co-wrote a letter asking for a pause on finance rules, saying the EU should \u201cshift gears and regain its capacity to compete in the global arena\u201d and \u201cput stronger emphasis on the competitiveness of the financial sector, particularly banking.\u201d\u00a0 To the surprise of many \u2014 especially those who drafted the original legal texts now on the chopping block \u2014 finance executives may be about to get what they want. Since coming out in favor of simplification in November, von der Leyen has announced a plan to consolidate three of the EU\u2019s flagship environmental disclosure laws in a sweeping legal text scheduled to be published in February. And yet, regulators are not the only ones who are worried about putting the profitability of the finance sector ahead of its safety. Thierry Philipponnat, chief economist at the NGO Finance Watch, said the \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d agenda was increasingly being used as an excuse to avoid completing the crucial work necessary to prevent another financial crisis. \u201cRecent moves to delay and dilute vital regulatory protections reflect a worrying trend where \u2018competitiveness\u2019 is repeatedly used as a pretext to weaken essential safeguards against financial risks,\u201d he said. This applies especially to global banking rules known as the Basel 3 standards. While the EU, U.K. and other countries have enacted the global rules in national legislation, the U.S. has delayed doing so following massive lobbying from the banking industry. Now, with Trump returning to the White House in a matter of weeks, the future of the rules looks uncertain \u2014 which creates a dilemma for the EU. Should the bloc push ahead with Basel 3 for the sake of banking stability and risk giving U.S. banks a competitive edge in the process? Or should it change direction and contribute to a broader weakening of standards? In a sign that regulators may be looking to stay the course, the EU and U.K. have hinted at a coordinated response if the proposals are ripped apart in the U.S. Villeroy de Galhau, speaking in Paris in November, called for a compromise that would simplify EU rules without necessarily upending global standards, explaining that \u201csimplifying does not mean deregulating.\u201d The Commission\u2019s job will be \u201cto find the fine line between a race to the bottom and the objective to stay competitive,\u201d said AXA\u2019s de Courtois. The industry, as a whole, is not opposed to such an outcome. No matter how onerous the EU\u2019s suite of incoming rules may be \u2014 from the Basel package to clearing updates to cyber rules for finance \u2014 industry more often than not prefers certainty over uncertainty. In this case, compliance with well-forecast rules is preferable to the limbo of new rules being torn up and renegotiated. One thing everyone can be sure of is that even if things end up getting substantially watered down, nobody will be keen to call the move deregulation. Dublin \u201cunderperformed\u201d in its race for the bloc\u2019s top jobs, especially those in economic policy, which it normally covets. Expect a rerun of the same old fights \u2014 from green rules to defense spending. Which EU bubble stalwarts can you find at Aspria? And who is graduating from Basic-Fit to ANIMO?\u00a0 July\u2019s major IT outage served as a wake-up call. But can the EU\u2019s regulatory response make a difference?"

We recently published a list of 11 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Marqeta, Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ) stands against other best NASDAQ penny stocks to buy right now. The NASDAQ Stock Market is home to some of the world\u2019s largest companies in the world and also hosts several hundred penny stocks. These companies must meet certain requirements to remain listed on the NASDAQ exchange, including the $1 per share minimum share price thresholds, revenue standards, and market capitalization thresholds. If a company fails to meet these requirements, it may receive noncompliance notifications and eventually be delisted. According to a report by Bloomberg, this year\u2019s market rally has boosted many of the struggling stocks, helping some companies regain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements. On December 3, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while addressing a conference in Washington, indicated that he is inclined to vote for a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 17-18. However, Waller emphasized that his decision will depend on the economic data released before the meeting, particularly if it shows an unexpected uptick in inflation. According to Bloomberg, New York Fed President John Williams in a speech in New York said that the economy is continuing to look strong and inflation is likely moving down toward the Fed\u2019s target. However, he emphasized that the path for monetary policy will be contingent upon incoming economic data. He underscored the uncertainty of the economic outlook, noting, \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything over the past five years, it\u2019s that the outlook remains highly uncertain.\u201d READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts\u00a0and\u00a07 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 15, Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, discussed his views on the US stocks and the potential of small caps. Colas recalled how U.S. stocks outperformed global markets during the first Trump administration. Colas acknowledged that current multiples are high, but he is optimistic and believes that multiples can hold or even rise, given the high level of confidence in the US market.\u00a0Regarding small caps, Colas suggested that they are a great trade for the year-end. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap performance, has been flat and lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the past three years, and presents an amazing opportunity, given that it typically sees a 20% increase. This underperformance makes small caps reasonable holds for the longer term, as they are due for a rebound. While the broader market is showing signs of overvaluation, small-cap, and penny stocks have lagged significantly behind over the past few years, creating a compelling opportunity for investors.

    "full_text": "In his latest video analysis on YouTube, Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures (CEHV), an activist venture capital firm, described Ripple\u2019s newly launched stablecoin, RLUSD, as a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d poised to transform both decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional banking sectors. Cochran emphasized the strategic significance of RLUSD, stating, \u201cRipple quietly dropped a bombshell and no one\u2019s really talking about it but it could dramatically revolutionize the position of Ripple in the marketplace.\u201d He elaborated that while the crypto community remains focused on XRP\u2019s price movements and its upcoming programmability upgrades, RLUSD represents a fundamental shift in XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. RLUSD differentiates itself from other stablecoins by adhering to stringent regulatory standards. Cochran highlighted, \u201cRLUSD isn\u2019t just another USDC clone; this is more into the original Paxos stablecoin that\u2019s NYDFS regulated, custodian issued, backed by secure cash assets.\u201d The stablecoin is exclusively backed by real US cash equivalents held in US banks registered with regulators and subject to regular audits. This regulatory compliance ensures that RLUSD meets stringent monetary transfer licenses, including a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, positioning it for use by EU exchanges and banks. Unlike other stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), RLUSD is set to be issued on both the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain. Cochran pointed out, \u201cRipple is making sure they themselves capture it and can provide more value into the ecosystem.\u201d Cochran posits that RLUSD is integral to unlocking the vast multi-trillion dollar Forex markets on the blockchain without necessitating advanced technological upgrades. \u201cThis stablecoin is going to unlock the ability for real-world asset (RWA) issuers, Forex issuers, currency issuers, and other programs to be able to price on a native AMM their assets in the US dollar,\u201d he remarked. The introduction of RLUSD is expected to facilitate the pricing of assets in US dollars directly on the XRPL\u2019s Automated Market Maker (AMM), thereby attracting institutional trading and Forex settlement activities. Cochran elaborated: \u201cRipple can begin to benefit from the yield that comes in and put that back into the XRP ecosystem.\u201d He suggests that the stablecoin could enhance liquidity on-chain, which is currently confined to opaque exchange balances: \u201cSophisticated participants don\u2019t want to have an AMM that trades against Ripple as the underlying currency. They want to be able to price their assets in the US dollar and until the launch of RLUSD that was something that wasn\u2019t possible. This stablecoin is going to unlock the ability for RWA assets, Forex issuers, currency issuers and other programs [\u2026] to allow Ripple to bring a lot of their overall liquidity on-chain.\u201d Ripple has long targeted institutional clients, including banks, financial institutions, and Forex traders. Cochran emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance, stating, \u201cIf Ripple can get their MA compliance approved and be offered in the EU and bring this stablecoin to diverse markets, they have a great opportunity to get these providers to integrate Ripple\u2019s Network by offering them on-chain yield and sharing of that yield.\u201d Moreover, the company\u2019s strategic focus on programmability through upcoming features like Hooks and an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain is expected to further enhance RLUSD\u2019s utility. \u201cRipple still really needs hooks and their EVM sidechain to perform well, get the programmability in place to be able to offer more sophisticated DeFi products,\u201d Cochran stated. The global stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), presents a significant opportunity for RLUSD, especially within the EU where regulatory frameworks are stringent. Cochran estimated, \u201cIf Ripple was to issue the same amount of stablecoins as Tether does nowadays, they\u2019d be looking at something like $5 billion a year potentially in yield gains.\u201d Cochran further pointed out the competitive edge RLUSD could provide Ripple, stating, \u201cThese are the type of asset issuers that care about RWA issuance, Forex settlement and interchange [\u2026] something that no one else in the DeFi space has the expertise or the interested parties or the tooling to be able to provide.\u201d Cochran concluded his analysis by affirming Ripple\u2019s strategic trajectory, \u201cRipple has a great potential path in front of it if it continues to execute on delivering the vision in the way that it wants to.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.51.

    "full_text": "Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Germany\u2019s largest bank Deutsche Bank is developing an Ethereum layer 2 network using ZKsync technology to enhance transaction efficiency and meet regulatory standards in finance, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The initiative, part of Project Dama 2 and linked to Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian, is aimed at resolving key issues for regulated lenders operating on public blockchains, such as unknown transaction validators, risks of payments to sanctioned entities, and unexpected hard forks. The goal is to enable banks to safely and securely utilize public blockchains for various financial services while addressing regulatory concerns, said Boon-Hiong Chan, Head of APAC Securities Market and Technology Advocacy at Deutsche Bank. The L2 solution will enable banks to create a \u201cmore bespoke list of validators\u201d and provide regulators with \u201csuper admin rights\u201d to monitor fund movements, he noted. The bank unveiled a test version of Project Dama 2, an asset-servicing pilot, in November. Incorporating a L2 solution into Project Dama 2 is also expected to offer cost-effectiveness benefits. \u201cUsing two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied,\u201d said Chan. \u201cYou are not dependent on the Layer 1 for detailed transaction records anymore,\u201d he added. Project Dama 2, developed in collaboration with Memento Blockchain and Interop Labs using ZKsync technology, is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian. This broader initiative involves 24 major financial institutions testing blockchain technology for asset tokenization. The bank plans to launch a minimum viable product next year, provided regulatory approval is received. Deutsche Bank has recently partnered with the crypto exchange Crypto.com to enhance corporate banking services in the Asia-Pacific region. The collaboration, announced on December 10, will initially focus on providing banking capabilities in Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong, with plans for future expansion into Europe and the UK. The collaboration is part of Crypto.com\u2019s broader global expansion strategy, which includes launching new products such as a stablecoin and an ETF by 2025.

    "full_text": "More results...  Businesses rely heavily on analytics to understand customers, optimize digital strategies, and improve ROI. However, with growing concerns about data privacy, compliance with laws like GDPR and HIPAA, and the limitations of free tools like Google Analytics, many companies are seeking more secure, flexible, and scalable solutions.  Google revolutionized the analytics industry by offering a free tool that democratized website and app data access. However, relying on a free platform for million-dollar business decisions comes with significant risks. Brands that depend on Google Analytics for critical insights may face limitations such as data sampling, lack of raw data access, and reduced flexibility in complying with privacy regulations.  Worse, as seen with the abrupt sunsetting of Universal Analytics and the lack of a seamless migration path to GA4, businesses are at the mercy of Google\u2019s product lifecycle decisions. A free tool with such vulnerabilities can ultimately be costly for organizations making high-stakes choices. Enter Piwik PRO Analytics: a powerful paid platform designed to provide unmatched control and reliability for organizations that demand accuracy and privacy in their data operations.

As one of the largest financiers of the fossil fuel industry, the bank\u2019s departure highlights growing skepticism about the necessity\u2014and even the legitimacy\u2014of these alliances. Following on the heels of Goldman Sachs, which left the NZBA earlier this month, Wells Fargo\u2019s exit marks a turning point for the global push toward so-called \u201cclimate finance.\u201d Congressman Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has characterized environmental coalitions like the NZBA as a \u201cclimate cartel,\u201d accusing them of fostering collusion, manipulating markets, and inflating energy prices. His committee has found what it describes as \u201csubstantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior\u201d by financial firms tied to these alliances. Against this backdrop, Wells Fargo\u2019s decision reflects a rational distancing from initiatives that are not only fraught with legal risks but also based on highly uncertain and contested climate science. The NZBA, launched in 2021 under the umbrella of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), sought to position itself as a linchpin of global climate policy. Over 100 major banks pledged to align their lending and investment portfolios with the Paris Agreement, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This framework purported to harness financial institutions as agents of climate salvation, mandating that they pressure clients to adopt \u201cgreen\u201d technologies while curtailing financing for fossil fuel projects\u200b\u200b. However, this approach is deeply flawed. The premise rests on an assumption that the climate crisis narrative is settled science\u2014an assertion that is far from proven. The models driving the net-zero agenda are riddled with uncertainties, from overstated temperature projections to underappreciated natural climate variability. Worse, they rely on speculative technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), that are expensive, unproven, and decades away from being scalable. It\u2019s no wonder that financial institutions like Wells Fargo are beginning to see through the cracks in these grandstanding commitments. Climate finance, as sold by groups like the NZBA, often prioritizes virtue signaling over economic and scientific reality. The political climate in the United States has become increasingly hostile to these climate initiatives, particularly under scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. Congressman Jordan\u2019s critique of the NZBA as a \u201cclimate cartel\u201d is emblematic of a broader skepticism toward the net-zero agenda. Lawsuits filed by states such as Texas accuse financial coalitions of violating antitrust laws and artificially raising energy prices by choking off investment in affordable fossil fuels\u200b. These allegations point to a larger problem: the NZBA\u2019s mission effectively imposes top-down, centralized control over critical economic sectors under the guise of climate stewardship. Such behavior is not only legally dubious but also antithetical to free-market principles. For a bank like Wells Fargo, which is deeply embedded in fossil fuel financing (ranking second in bond and loan arrangements for the industry since 2020), remaining in the NZBA could jeopardize its relationships with clients and open the door to regulatory and reputational risks\u200b. One of the most glaring issues with alliances like the NZBA is their reliance on the assumption that urgent \u201cclimate action\u201d is both necessary and beneficial. This assumption is built on shaky foundations. The science underpinning catastrophic climate predictions is not as settled as advocates claim. Historical climate variability, model inaccuracies, and questionable data adjustments undermine the narrative of imminent climate catastrophe. Moreover, policies derived from these flawed premises often lead to unintended consequences, such as rising energy prices, economic instability, and increased geopolitical tensions. The push for rapid decarbonization ignores these uncertainties while promoting strategies that could destabilize economies and undermine societal resilience. Renewables like wind and solar, while growing in capacity, remain unreliable and insufficient to meet global energy demands without massive\u2014and expensive\u2014upgrades to grid infrastructure. Meanwhile, fossil fuels continue to supply the majority of global energy, ensuring stability and growth in developing nations and industrial economies alike. Wells Fargo\u2019s departure from the NZBA is a tacit acknowledgment of these realities. Rather than investing in speculative green technologies and committing to unattainable emissions targets, the bank is choosing to prioritize its fiduciary duties and economic responsibilities. Wells Fargo is not alone in questioning the logic of environmental coalitions. Goldman Sachs, Franklin Templeton, and others have recently withdrawn from climate initiatives like the NZBA and Climate Action 100+, citing similar concerns about the economic and legal implications of their participation\u200b\u200b. This trend signals a growing rejection of what can only be described as \u201cgreen dogma.\u201d These initiatives demand sweeping changes to the global economy without providing clear evidence of their effectiveness or feasibility. Worse, they often fail to consider the unintended consequences of their policies\u2014such as higher energy costs, reduced industrial competitiveness, and the exacerbation of energy poverty in vulnerable regions. For financial institutions, the calculus is increasingly clear: remaining in these alliances poses more risks than rewards. The costs of adhering to net-zero commitments\u2014both in terms of compliance and reputational risks\u2014are rapidly outpacing any perceived benefits. Wells Fargo\u2019s exit from the NZBA is not a failure of climate policy\u2014it\u2019s an indictment of its premises. The assumption that we face a climate crisis demanding urgent, radical action is not supported by the evidence. Instead, the uncertainties surrounding climate science, the limitations of renewable technologies, and the economic risks of decarbonization suggest that a more cautious approach is warranted. Rather than capitulating to politically driven alliances that dictate economic behavior under the guise of saving the planet, institutions like Wells Fargo are demonstrating the value of skepticism and pragmatism. In truth, the world does not need sweeping climate action\u2014it needs stability, economic growth, and a rational approach to addressing environmental challenges that avoids sacrificing prosperity on the altar of ideology. As the NZBA and similar initiatives face growing scrutiny, it is time to rethink the entire premise of climate finance. Instead of chasing utopian visions, the focus should shift to policies and practices grounded in evidence, market dynamics, and a recognition of the complex realities of global energy systems. Until then, the exodus from these alliances will likely continue\u2014and rightly so.

Let the renewable industrial complex compete to raise money from banks the old fashioned way. Make a case for the loans- show the risk- show evidence of profitability. Any bank lowering its standards to prove they\u2019re politically correct is hurting its owners. Fiduciary responsibility? I agree. A stockholder suit against the companies for violating fiduciary responsibilities in favor of political virtue signaling might be successful, if brought in the right jurisdiction. I don\u2019t know that they violated their fiduciary responsibility.   Maybe just the opposite:\nVirtue signal to the administration and avoid unpleasant government scrutiny.  Write a bunch of no risk bad loans guaranteed by the government.  Collect large upfront fees.   That gravy train is coming to an end, so time to pivot to the new administration and write a bunch of performing loans to hydrocarbon producers. The banks and large institutions are telling governments that they need to make rules that guarantee income from \u201crenewables\u201d investment.  That is why Australia has changed to a direct government guarantee model and a secret tender process for new projects.\nhttps://aemoservices.com.au/tenders?filters=on#filters It appears the sole risk now in Australia  is sovereign although the project details are only known by the government, proponents and financial backers.  What are the chances that the next government will unwind the guarantees on in openly supporting NetZero. The Albanese government has directed Australia\u2019s wealth fund to invest in \u201crenewables\u201d projects.  This is the retirement fund for Federal employees.  So government employees are involved in providing guarantees for their own retirement income from future generations of taxpayers; essentially defined benefits rather than market exposed.. \u201cguarantee income from \u201crenewables\u201d investment\u201d No investment should be guaranteed of profitability. Other, maybe, than US Savings Bonds. How big utilities manipulate the energy market, even with a high share of wind and solar | RenewEconomy It\u2019s not fair! We manipulated the communal grid market to actively encourage dumping by fickles with no voltage and frequency control and those pesky dispatchables are making hay when the fickles go bye byes in order to survive. Either that or getting big handouts from Gummint like Eraring to stay open against the \u2018saturated\u2019 dumping.  I don\u2019t make this stuff up. These people are experts with letters after their names Virtue signaling in. Common sense signaling out. Slow, very slow, initial collapse of the whole climate thing. 6b\u2026With any like, we can get rid of Albosleazy and Bow-wow next election in Australia. They can see the handwriting on the wall.\nThe new administration is going hydrocarbon-based fuels.  That is where the money is going to be. As to the climate alliance:  mene, mene, tekel, parsin There is an intriguing article at tabletmag.com; \u201cRapid Onset Political Enlightenment,\u201d that makes the case that all of these neo- or cultural Marxist mind viruses were introduced by Obama Regime ideologues in an attempt to acquire one-party rule in the US! 2024 was supposed to be the fifth term of the Obama Regime, yet somehow the growing disillusion with DEI and ESG, and Elon\u2019s purchase of Twitter or X, enabled common sense to resurface in American politics!\nWhether the UniParty in DC will cripple the Trump administration again, or enough power will be returned to We, The People, remains to be seen. All we can be sure of right now is that our vile Congress critters will employ the usual MO; the criminally inclined DemoKKKrats will break every law and rule they safely can, and the RINO Repubicans will stupidly go along to preserve their place at the feeding trough! Apparently, Wells Fargo will not be returning to moving it\u2019s cash reserves by stagecoach anytime soon. Very nice Charles, well done. \u00a0Wells Fargo is trying to clean up its messes.\nHalf of the Wikipedia entry is about \u201cLawsuits, fines, and controversies\u201d.\nIt has not been a nice company. Wells Fargo mergers included Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation (1998) {U. S. legal HQ in Sioux Falls} and Wachovia of Charlotte NC (2008). It has Midtown Manhattan executive headquarters at 30 Hudson Yards NYC. It is downsizing in San Francisco. Remembering always John that Wikipedia entries always have to be taken with several billion grains of salt.\nThe bias and slant that contributors and editors there apply to many subjects rivals what happens on PBS, CNN, WAPO, NYT, MSNBC, ABC, CBC, etc etc BS talks, while the money walks! NG is moving close to $4 a MBTU\u2019s.  NG production requires continuous investment on Fracked wells to maintain production they go flat fast. Imagine freezing in the dark on the coldest days of the year. Let\u2019s get fracking for Gas before you freeze your a$$ It appears common sense is starting to win in America.  To keep it going we need to fix our voting.  The Marxists will stop at nothing to gain control. They rarely bless us by committing seppuku; worst luck!

Trade finance is the engine behind global trade, ensuring the seamless flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. In 2024, its importance has only grown as businesses increasingly rely on innovative financial instruments to mitigate risks and unlock new opportunities in global markets. It is estimated that the majority of global merchandise exports, particularly in emerging markets, are supported by some form of trade finance. This highlights how integral these mechanisms are for both SMEs and multinational corporations (MNCs). By bridging the gap between buyers and sellers, trade finance not only facilitates payments but also ensures trust in complex cross-border transactions. Download Sample Copy @ https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/trade-finance-market However, the trade finance market remains a paradox of progress and challenges. While digital tools such as blockchain and AI-based compliance systems have significantly expedited transaction times, around 60% of global trade documentation is still paper-based. This inefficiency persists despite the fact that digital trade finance solutions have reduced error rates and compliance discrepancies by over a quarter in pilot programs. Furthermore, SMEs, which account for a significant portion of global trade, continue to face barriers in accessing trade finance due to rigid risk assessment frameworks. As international trade expands, trade finance systems are increasingly required to manage not just financial risk but also align with sustainability goals, regulatory frameworks, and geopolitical complexities. This duality\u2014rapid innovation and lingering inefficiencies\u2014makes trade finance both a challenge and an opportunity for global commerce. Key Findings in Global Trade Finance Market Bridging the Gap: Exploring the Key Providers in Trade Finance The trade finance market ecosystem is no longer dominated solely by traditional banks. While leading financial institutions such as HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, and Barclays remain central to the market, the rise of FinTech companies and multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) has diversified the landscape in 2024. These banks, with their vast global networks, continue to process the majority of trade finance transactions, leveraging their scale and deep capital reserves to provide services such as letters of credit and supply chain financing. For example, HSBC has proven particularly dominant in Asia-Pacific, where its real-time trade platforms and integration of foreign exchange services provide unmatched value to exporters and importers. Similarly, JPMorgan\u2019s innovative use of blockchain and AI technologies has set new benchmarks for efficiency, reducing transaction times while ensuring compliance with global regulations. At the same time, FinTech innovators in the global trade finance market are carving out a niche by offering automated platforms that cater to underserved segments, particularly SMEs. These platforms streamline trade finance processes, slashing approval times by up to 40% and enabling smaller businesses to access liquidity quickly. Meanwhile, MFIs such as the World Bank and regional development banks are playing a vital role in addressing financing gaps in emerging economies by underwriting guarantees and providing capacity-building programs. By collaborating with both traditional banks and FinTech firms, MFIs ensure that trade finance becomes more inclusive and accessible. The interplay between these providers has created a dynamic ecosystem, where innovation and collaboration are essential to meeting the evolving demands of global trade. Navigating Risk and Opportunity: Understanding Trade Finance Instruments Trade finance encompasses a wide range of instruments that enable businesses to navigate the complexities of international trade. In 2024, the two most prominent instruments\u2014documentary credits such as letters of credit and open account transactions\u2014continue to dominate global trade finance market. Letter of credit with higher market share of nearly 39% remain indispensable for high-risk markets, offering a secure payment mechanism for exporters and importers alike. Despite the rise of more flexible options, letters of credit still account for millions of transactions annually, thanks to their unparalleled ability to mitigate risk. On the other hand, open account transactions have become the preferred method in developed economies, representing over 70% of cross-border commerce due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In addition to these traditional instruments, new trade finance solutions are reshaping the trade finance market landscape. Supply chain financing, for instance, has seen rapid adoption, particularly in industries with complex value chains such as automotive and electronics. Similarly, invoice discounting and factoring have gained traction among SMEs, helping them bridge cashflow gaps and manage working capital more effectively. Even asset-backed financing models are emerging as viable options for high-value exports such as machinery and infrastructure projects. These diverse instruments reflect the adaptability of trade finance, enabling businesses to manage liquidity, reduce payment risks, and expand into new markets. However, the use of these instruments also underscores the importance of trust, collaboration, and regulatory alignment in ensuring their smooth operation. From Manual Labor to Automation: The Digital Transformation of Trade Finance The trade finance market has entered a new era of digital transformation, driven by the need for efficiency and compliance in an increasingly complex global trade environment. While manual processes once dominated the sector, advancements in technology are revolutionizing how transactions are conducted. Automated trade platforms, powered by AI and machine learning, have reduced processing times for letters of credit and other instruments by up to 70%. These tools also address long-standing inefficiencies, such as document compliance errors, which have historically delayed international transactions. For example, AI-powered document-checking solutions can now identify and rectify discrepancies in trade documents with far greater accuracy than manual methods. However, the road to digitization is not without its hurdles in the trade finance market. Despite the evident benefits, only a fraction of global customs authorities fully accept electronic documents, creating bottlenecks in the end-to-end trade process. Furthermore, legacy systems still dominate many banks, limiting their ability to adopt cutting-edge technologies. Blockchain, hailed as a game-changer for trade finance, has yet to achieve widespread adoption due to regulatory uncertainty and interoperability challenges. Nonetheless, progress is being made: major blockchain consortia involving global banks have grown significantly in size, and smart contracts are increasingly being piloted to automate payment triggers. As 2024 unfolds, the industry stands at a crossroads, where the adoption of digital tools will determine its ability to meet the demands of a fast-paced, interconnected world. Ask For Customization @ https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/trade-finance-market Green Finance is Poised to Change the Face of Trade Finance Market in Years to Come  The future of trade finance market is being shaped by two powerful forces: sustainability and technological innovation. In 2024, green finance has emerged as a critical trend, with banks and investors prioritizing projects aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Green trade finance instruments, tailored for industries such as renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, are gaining traction, reflecting the growing demand for environmentally conscious financing solutions. Banks are also integrating ESG metrics into their trade finance portfolios, ensuring that their lending practices align with global sustainability goals. This shift is not just a moral imperative but an economic one, as businesses increasingly view ESG compliance as a competitive differentiator. On the technological front, blockchain and smart contracts are poised to redefine the trade finance market landscape. By enabling real-time updates and automated payment triggers, these technologies promise to enhance transparency and efficiency while reducing fraud. Similarly, AI-driven platforms are transforming risk assessment processes, making it easier for SMEs to access trade finance. However, the successful adoption of these innovations will depend on global regulatory harmonization. Efforts by organizations such as the G20 to align trade finance regulations across borders are critical in ensuring that new technologies can be deployed at scale. By embracing sustainability and innovation, the trade finance industry has the potential to unlock new levels of efficiency, inclusivity, and resilience, paving the way for a more sustainable and interconnected global economy. Dominant Triad: HSBC, JPMORGAN, and BARCLAYS Shaping Global Trade Finance Market HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Barclays Bank stand atop the trade finance market landscape with collective market share of over 27.5% in 2024 due to their expansive international footprint, advanced digital infrastructures, and robust capital reserves. Their ability to support a broad range of instruments\u2014from letters of credit to complex supply chain financing\u2014positions them as first-choice providers for corporates and SMEs alike. Each institution\u2019s global presence also ensures local expertise, making their offerings highly attractive across developed and emerging markets. HSBC, for example, processes one of the highest volumes of trade finance transactions in the Asia-Pacific region, supported by a dynamic suite of e-platforms that integrates financing, foreign exchange, and real-time shipment tracking. JPMorgan is recognized for its sophisticated digital solutions, particularly in the realm of blockchain pilots and AI-based document verification, slashing processing times while reinforcing compliance. Meanwhile, Barclays has capitalized on strong partnerships with FinTech firms in the trade finance market, focusing on supply chain finance programs that cater to Europe\u2019s industrial base. All three banks operate with stringent due diligence protocols that minimize fraud and money laundering risks, contributing to their leadership status. Collectively, their global contribution to trade finance spans standardization efforts, technology investments, and product innovation. Recent data from the ICC ranks them among the top three in terms of client satisfaction and transaction volume, highlighting their consistent performance in moving trillions of dollars across borders. Through consolidated expertise, these institutions demonstrate how scale, innovation, and a keen focus on customer needs can set an elevated benchmark, driving the entire market toward higher efficiency and trust.

    "full_text": "Events Join the DZone community and get the full member experience. Large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI with their ability to process and generate human-like text. However, their static pre-trained knowledge presents challenges for dynamic, real-time tasks requiring current information or domain-specific expertise. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by integrating LLMs with external data sources. When paired with AI agents that orchestrate workflows, RAG-based infrastructure becomes a powerful tool for real-time decision-making, analytics, and automation.  The architecture of a RAG-based AI system includes several core components: A RAG-based system retrieves known fraud patterns from a vector database and analyzes real-time transactions for anomalies. If a match is detected, an AI agent escalates the case for review, enhancing financial security. Legal assistants leverage LLMs with RAG to extract key clauses and flag potential risks in contracts. Indexed legal databases enable quick retrieval of precedent cases or regulatory guidelines, reducing manual review time. In education, AI agents generate personalized lesson plans by retrieving resources from academic databases based on a student\u2019s performance. The LLM contextualizes this information, offering customized recommendations for improvement. RAG-based AI infrastructure powered by LLMs\u00a0and AI agents bridges the gap between static pre-trained knowledge and dynamic, real-time requirements. At the same time, the system's complexity and data dependencies present challenges, its ability to integrate live data and automate workflows makes it invaluable in applications like finance, healthcare, and education. With advancements in frameworks like LangChain and Pinecone, the adoption of RAG-based systems is poised to grow, delivering smarter, context-aware solutions.

Charlie Scharf\u2019s comments, as reported Wednesday (Dec. 11) by Reuters, follow the banking giant\u2019s years-long fake account scandal. \u201cFor every one of our consent orders that we have, for every one of our regulatory deliverables, we have extremely detailed plans in place that the regulators have reviewed,\u201d he told the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference. \u201cWe track our progress at the operating committee every single week.\u201d As Reuters noted, Wells Fargo is in the final stages of working to pass regulatory tests so it can in 2025 remove a $1.95 trillion asset cap as a result of the scandal. The asset cap, considered one of the harshest punishments American regulators can hand down, was put in place in 2018 after Wells Fargo failed to deal with governance and risk-management problems following years of consumer abuses. The limit hinders Wells Fargo\u2019s ability to accept more deposits and boost its trading business, two potential growth areas for the bank, the CEO said earlier this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually taken balance sheet over the years away from our trading businesses, predominantly in terms of what they\u2019re able to finance,\u201d Scharf said at the Goldman conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to give some of that back to them, and so we\u2019ll continue to build that part of the business, which will benefit them.\u201d In September, Wells Fargo signed a formal agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to rectify deficiencies in the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering (AML) and financial crimes risk management practices. \u201cWe have been working to address a substantial portion of what\u2019s required in the formal agreement, and we are committed to completing the work with the same sense of urgency as our other regulatory commitments,\u201d the bank said in a statement at the time. Meanwhile, the Reuters report also noted that Scharf on Wednesday expressed confidence that the incoming Trump administration would take measures to strengthen the U.S. economy. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very focused on ensuring that a broad group of Americans, both individuals and companies are successful,\u201d he said. His comments were echoed Tuesday by the head of another big bank, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who projected an uptick in dealmaking next year, in part due to a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors."

    "full_text": "The business landscape has undergone a seismic shift with the rise of hybrid work environments, and remote approval workflows have become a linchpin of operational efficiency. As we head into 2025, the trends and advancements in remote approval management will shape how businesses operate, ensuring compliance, efficiency, and seamless collaboration across geographically dispersed teams. This article explores the key trends and predictions for remote approval management, emphasizing the role of emerging technologies and strategies in transforming the approval process. Remote approval management is a vital component of modern workflows, ensuring that decisions are made promptly without the need for in-person meetings or manual processes. Key benefits include: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing decision-making by analyzing data patterns and providing actionable insights. The adoption of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms allows organizations to design customized approval workflows without extensive coding expertise. Blockchain technology ensures immutability and transparency, crucial for audit trails in industries like finance, healthcare, and legal. With the global workforce becoming increasingly mobile, approvals must be accessible on smartphones and tablets. Collaborative platforms integrate directly with approval workflows, allowing: Data analytics tools offer granular insights into approval trends and bottlenecks. Regulatory landscapes are becoming more stringent, making compliance-focused workflows a necessity. As personalization becomes paramount, approval workflows will adapt dynamically to individual preferences, such as language, notification settings, and interface design. AI and Machine Learning will play a pivotal role in creating these personalized experiences. A unified platform for managing all approvals, regardless of the system or application, will emerge as a standard, reducing complexity and centralizing control. Incorporating gamified elements, such as rewards for quick approvals or achieving specific milestones, will boost user engagement and reduce delays. Decentralized systems will distribute approval responsibilities across nodes, enhancing resilience and reducing the risk of bottlenecks. Sustainability will drive the adoption of paperless and energy-efficient systems, aligning approval processes with broader environmental goals. Despite technological advancements, security remains a top priority. Organizations must: Resistance to change can hinder the adoption of new systems. Strategies include: Ensuring seamless integration between various tools and systems is essential for efficiency. Organizations should invest in platforms with open APIs and strong compatibility. A global manufacturing company implemented AI-powered approval workflows to streamline multilevel approvals across regions. The result? A 40% reduction in processing time and enhanced compliance. A healthcare provider adopted LC/NC platforms to integrate remote approvals with their electronic health records (EHR) system. This transformation improved response times for critical approvals, such as patient care plans. Remote approval management is no longer a luxury but a necessity in the fast-paced, digital-first business world. The trends and predictions outlined above highlight a future where technology enhances speed, transparency, and collaboration in approval workflows. As we embrace 2025, organizations must proactively adopt these advancements to stay competitive and agile. From AI-driven insights to blockchain transparency, the future of remote approval management is bright, promising unparalleled efficiency and innovation. \u00a9 2011 - 2025 eLearning Industry"

    "full_text": "The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has released a discussion paper outlining several proposals and inviting public feedback on crypto regulations in the country. Notably, one proposal seeks to ban public crypto offers from non-regulated entities. According to the FCA, the proposals \u2013 detailed in the discussion paper titled \u201cDP24/4\u201d \u2013 aim to mitigate risks associated with digital assets while fostering growth and innovation within the sector. The paper is directed toward investors, crypto firms, industry groups, and other professional bodies involved in the virtual assets space. One proposal garnering significant attention is a potential ban on public virtual assets offers. The UK government\u2019s economic and finance ministry, HM Treasury, is pushing to outlaw most public crypto fundraising, with exceptions likely made for entities already operating in the UK or those qualifying under specific exemptions.\u00a0 The FCA\u2019s move aligns with broader efforts by regulators worldwide to tighten controls on unregulated offerings, which have often been associated with scams, investor losses, and market manipulation. Draft legislation is expected to formalize the ban, signaling a notable regulatory shift. This development follows the FCA\u2019s recent crackdown on Solana-based platform Pump.fun, which was barred from operating in the UK due to its failure to secure the necessary permit. Beyond the proposed public offer ban, the FCA has also suggested that authorized digital assets trading platforms share market abuse data to identify and address suspicious activities. This initiative seeks to enhance transparency and improve user safety in the crypto sector. The discussion paper further invites feedback on market admission, disclosure practices, and measures to tackle market abuse. The FCA has set a deadline of March 14, 2025, for stakeholders to submit their comments and input. Other European countries have also called for global cooperation when it comes to regulating digital assets. For instance, countries like Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands are mulling implementing tax monitoring rules to better align with European Union (EU) tax standards. This paper is part of a broader effort to define the UK\u2019s crypto regulatory regime, with additional papers expected to follow. Notably, draft legislation is anticipated next year, with the full regulatory framework slated for implementation by 2026. The timing of the discussion paper coincides with mounting concerns over low regulatory compliance among digital assets companies. A recent report revealed that nearly 90% of digital assets entities in the UK fail to meet anti-money laundering (AML) standards. Regulators worry that lax compliance could expose the financial system to illicit activities, including fraud and money laundering. In October, the FCA was urged to investigate short-form video hosting platform TikTok over allegations of illegally operating as a cryptocurrency trading platform. These incidents underscore the watchdog\u2019s increasing vigilance in safeguarding financial markets. Despite regulatory challenges, virtual assets adoption in the UK remains strong. According to an FCA report, approximately 7 million UK adults currently hold digital assets. While the FCA\u2019s push for tighter regulations is aimed at protecting market participants, it faces the challenge of avoiding excessive measures that might drive digital assets businesses to relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. For instance, the US has seen renewed optimism following the election victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump. At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $105,998, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.
